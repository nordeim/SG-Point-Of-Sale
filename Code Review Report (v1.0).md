### Code Review Process

My review process followed these rigorous steps:
1.  **Project Structure Analysis:** I first parsed the file hierarchy to understand the high-level organization and logical separation of the project into layers (`ui`, `business_logic`, `services`, `models`).
2.  **Full Codebase Ingestion:** I conducted a line-by-line analysis of every source file provided, from the top-level configuration (`pyproject.toml`) down to the individual UI, business, and data model definitions.
3.  **Cross-Referencing and Validation:** I critically compared different sources of truth within the project. Specifically, I cross-referenced the SQLAlchemy ORM models (`app/models/`) against the database schema (`scripts/database/schema.sql`) and the initial Alembic migration file (`migrations/versions/...`). This is crucial for ensuring data layer integrity.
4.  **Architectural Assessment:** I evaluated the overall architecture against modern software engineering principles (e.g., SOLID, Clean Architecture) and the project's stated goals in the `README.md`.
5.  **Synthesis and Documentation:** Finally, I synthesized all findings into this comprehensive report, categorizing them for clarity and providing actionable recommendations.

### Codebase Understanding and Architecture

My analysis confirms that the SG-POS project is a well-architected, layered desktop application. Its primary purpose is to serve as a robust Point-of-Sale system for Singaporean SMBs, with a strong emphasis on maintainability and code quality.

The architecture is cleanly separated into four distinct layers, ensuring a unidirectional flow of data and control, which is excellent for decoupling and testability.

#### Architectural Diagram and Interaction Flow

The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the primary components of the application.

```

**Typical Interaction Flow (e.g., Creating a Customer):**
1.  A user fills out the `CustomerDialog` (`app/ui/dialogs/customer_dialog.py`) and clicks "Save".
2.  The dialog's slot (`_on_save_accepted`) creates a coroutine to call the appropriate business logic manager.
3.  This coroutine is passed to the `AsyncBridge` (`app/core/async_bridge.py`), which runs it on a separate worker thread to avoid freezing the UI.
4.  The `ApplicationCore` (`app/core/application_core.py`) provides the `CustomerManager` instance to the running task.
5.  The `CustomerManager` (`app/business_logic/managers/customer_manager.py`) receives a `CustomerCreateDTO`, validates business rules (e.g., checking for duplicate codes), and calls the `CustomerService`.
6.  The `CustomerService` (`app/services/customer_service.py`) translates the request into a SQLAlchemy operation, creating a `Customer` ORM model instance.
7.  The service uses the `ApplicationCore`'s session factory to interact with the PostgreSQL database, persisting the new customer record.
8.  The result (either `Success` or `Failure`) propagates back up the chain. The `AsyncBridge` emits a `callback_ready` signal containing the result.
9.  The `CallbackExecutor` in `ApplicationCore` receives this signal and executes the original UI callback safely on the main thread.
10. The UI then displays an appropriate success or error message to the user.

### Assessment and Findings

The codebase demonstrates a high level of technical proficiency and adherence to best practices. However, as with any complex project, there are areas with critical issues, inconsistencies, and opportunities for improvement.

#### âœ… Architectural Strengths

*   **Excellent Separation of Concerns:** The 4-layer architecture is implemented cleanly and consistently, making the system easy to reason about and maintain.
*   **Asynchronous UI:** The `AsyncBridge` is a robust solution to the classic problem of long-running tasks in a desktop GUI, ensuring a responsive user experience.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `ApplicationCore` acts as an effective DI Container, lazy-loading services and managers. This reduces coupling and simplifies component instantiation.
*   **Explicit Error Handling:** The use of the `Result` pattern (`Success`/`Failure`) in the business and service layers is a superb choice. It makes error handling explicit and avoids using exceptions for predictable control flow.
*   **Strong Foundation:** The project configuration (`pyproject.toml`), tooling (Poetry, Ruff, Black, MyPy), and `README.md` are comprehensive and professional.

#### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues & Bugs

1.  **Schema Mismatch between ORM and Alembic Migration:** This is the most critical issue. The initial Alembic migration file (`migrations/versions/d5a6759ef2f7...py`) is out of sync with the latest SQLAlchemy models in `app/models/`. If `alembic upgrade head` is run on a fresh database, the resulting schema will be incorrect and will cause runtime errors.
    *   **Example 1:** `journal_entries` in the migration has `source_transaction_id` and `source_transaction_type`, while the `accounting.py` model defines them as `reference_id` and `reference_type`.
    *   **Example 2:** The `sales_transactions` table in the migration has a `UNIQUE` constraint on `transaction_number` that is not scoped to `company_id`, which is incorrect for a multi-tenant system. The model has the correct composite constraint `UniqueConstraint('company_id', 'transaction_number', ...)` which is missing from the migration file.
    *   **Example 3:** The `journal_entry_lines` check constraint in the migration allows `debit_amount` and `credit_amount` to both be zero, while the model correctly specifies `debit_amount != credit_amount`.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. The database schema will not match the application's expectations. This must be fixed before any further development.

2.  **Missing `company_manager` in `ApplicationCore`:** The `SettingsView` attempts to call `self.core.company_manager`, but this property is not defined in `app/core/application_core.py`. The code comment in `settings_view.py` acknowledges this, but it will cause a runtime `AttributeError`.

#### ðŸŸ¡ Code Quality and Best Practice Improvements

1.  **Project Cleanup:**
    *   The file `app/ui/main_window.py-diag` is a temporary diagnostic file and should be deleted.
    *   The numerous `__pycache__` directories listed in the file structure indicate that a `.gitignore` file is either missing or incomplete. These compiled Python files should never be tracked in version control.
    *   The file `app/ui/widgets/searchable_table_view.py` is empty and should either be implemented or removed to avoid confusion.

2.  **Inconsistent Service Layer Implementation:**
    *   `CustomerService` and `ProductService` define their own `create_*` and `update_*` methods, while other services rely on the generic `create` and `update` methods from `BaseService`. This is inconsistent. The custom methods should be removed in favor of the base implementation to reduce code duplication, unless they contain specific logic not present in the base class.

3.  **Unresolved `TODO` Comments:** The codebase contains several `TODO` comments (e.g., handling `variant_id` in `stock_adjustment_dialog.py`). These represent known work items that should be logged in a formal issue tracker to ensure they are not forgotten.

4.  **Hardcoded Values:** The GST rate is hardcoded to `Decimal("9.00")` in `app/models/product.py`. While correct for the current standard, this is a value that can change. It would be more robust to define this in `app/core/config.py` so it can be managed in one central location.

5.  **Potentially Missing `get_by_ids` Method:** The `SalesManager` assumes the existence of a `product_service.get_by_ids()` method for efficient batch fetching of products. This method is not defined in `BaseService` or `ProductService`, which will cause a runtime error.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

The SG-POS project is off to an excellent start with a professional, scalable, and maintainable architecture. The foundational work is solid. The primary challenges are not in the high-level design but in the details of implementation, specifically ensuring the data layer is perfectly consistent.

I strongly recommend the following prioritized action plan to stabilize the codebase and prepare it for future development:

1.  **[CRITICAL] Correct the Database Layer:**
    *   **Action:** Manually edit the Alembic migration file (`d5a6759ef2f7...py`) to perfectly match the schema defined by the SQLAlchemy ORM models in `app/models/`. Pay close attention to column names, constraints, and relationships.
    *   **Validation:** After correcting the migration, drop the database, recreate it, and run `alembic upgrade head`. Then, use a database inspection tool to verify that the resulting schema is 100% identical to the one described in `scripts/database/schema.sql` and expected by the ORM models.

2.  **[HIGH] Implement Missing Core Components:**
    *   **Action:** Add the lazy-loaded `company_manager` property to `app/core/application_core.py` to resolve the error in `SettingsView`.
    *   **Action:** Implement the `get_by_ids` method in `app/services/base_service.py` to prevent the runtime error in `SalesManager`.

3.  **[MEDIUM] Project Housekeeping:**
    *   **Action:** Create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.env.dev`, and other temporary files.
    *   **Action:** Delete the extraneous `app/ui/main_window.py-diag` file.
    *   **Action:** Delete the empty `app/ui/widgets/searchable_table_view.py` file.

4.  **[LOW] Code Refactoring and Consistency:**
    *   **Action:** Refactor `CustomerService` and `ProductService` to remove redundant methods and leverage the `BaseService` implementation.
    *   **Action:** Move the hardcoded GST rate to `app/core/config.py`.
    *   **Action:** Go through all `TODO` comments and create issues for them in your project management system.

By addressing these points, particularly the critical database schema mismatch, the SG-POS project will be in an exceptionally strong position to move forward with implementing its roadmap features on a stable and reliable foundation.
