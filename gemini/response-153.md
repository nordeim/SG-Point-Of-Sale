### **CodeNavigator's Deep Thought Process**

**1. Deconstruct the User's Request**

*   **Primary Goal:** Proceed with the next step in the Phase 4 plan.
*   **Current State:** Sub-Task 4.1 (Test Fixture Setup) and Sub-Task 4.2 (`SalesManager` tests) are complete. The project now has a foundational test suite for its most complex business logic.
*   **Next Step from Plan:** The original plan only detailed up to testing `SalesManager`. The next logical step is to expand test coverage to other critical managers. The `InventoryManager` is a perfect candidate as it has several complex, state-changing methods (`adjust_stock`, `create_purchase_order`, `receive_purchase_order_items`) that are crucial to the application's correctness.
*   **Methodology for New Sub-Task:**
    *   **Objective:** Write unit tests for the `InventoryManager`.
    *   **Artifact to Produce:** A new test file: `tests/unit/business_logic/managers/test_inventory_manager.py`.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Create the test file.
        2.  Identify the key methods to test in `InventoryManager`.
        3.  For each method, design test cases for success and failure paths.
        4.  Use the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern, leveraging the existing `pytest` fixtures and factories.

**2. Detailed Execution Plan & Checklist for Sub-Task 4.3**

I will now define the next sub-task and its detailed plan.

**Phase 4, Sub-Task 4.3: `InventoryManager` Unit Tests**

**Objective:** To create unit tests for the core methods of the `InventoryManager`, ensuring that stock adjustments, purchase order creation, and goods receipt workflows are all functioning correctly and transactionally.

**File to Create:** `tests/unit/business_logic/managers/test_inventory_manager.py`

*   **Test Case 1: `test_adjust_stock_success`**
    *   **Goal:** Verify that a stock adjustment correctly changes the inventory level and logs a movement.
    *   **Checklist (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
        *   **Arrange:**
            *   [ ] Create a product and a user using factories.
            *   [ ] Create an initial `Inventory` record for the product with a known quantity (e.g., 50).
            *   [ ] Create a `StockAdjustmentDTO` to change the stock to a new quantity (e.g., 55).
        *   **Act:**
            *   [ ] `await test_core.inventory_manager.adjust_stock(dto)`.
        *   **Assert:**
            *   [ ] Assert the result is a `Success`.
            *   [ ] Query the `Inventory` table and assert the `quantity_on_hand` is now the new quantity (55).
            *   [ ] Query the `StockMovement` table and assert a single `ADJUSTMENT_IN` record was created with a `quantity_change` of +5.

*   **Test Case 2: `test_adjust_stock_to_negative_fails`**
    *   **Goal:** Verify that an adjustment that would result in a negative stock level fails and rolls back.
    *   **Checklist (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
        *   **Arrange:**
            *   [ ] Create a product and user.
            *   [ ] Create an `Inventory` record with quantity 10.
            *   [ ] Create a `StockAdjustmentDTO` that attempts to set the counted quantity to -5 (or a change of -15).
        *   **Act:**
            *   [ ] `await test_core.inventory_manager.adjust_stock(dto)`.
        *   **Assert:**
            *   [ ] Assert the result is a `Failure`.
            *   [ ] Query the `Inventory` table and assert the `quantity_on_hand` is still 10.
            *   [ ] Query the `StockMovement` table and assert it is empty.

*   **Test Case 3: `test_create_purchase_order_success`**
    *   **Goal:** Verify that a PO and its items are created correctly.
    *   **Checklist (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
        *   **Arrange:**
            *   [ ] Create a product and a supplier using factories.
            *   [ ] Create a `PurchaseOrderCreateDTO` with one or more `PurchaseOrderItemCreateDTO`s.
        *   **Act:**
            *   [ ] `await test_core.inventory_manager.create_purchase_order(dto)`.
        *   **Assert:**
            *   [ ] Assert the result is a `Success` and returns a `PurchaseOrderDTO`.
            *   [ ] Query the `PurchaseOrder` table and assert one record was created with the correct `total_amount`.
            *   [ ] Query the `PurchaseOrderItem` table and assert the correct number of line items were created.

*   **Test Case 4: `test_receive_purchase_order_items_success`**
    *   **Goal:** Verify that receiving items against a PO correctly updates the PO item, increases inventory, and logs a stock movement.
    *   **Checklist (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
        *   **Arrange:**
            *   [ ] Use the manager to create a `PurchaseOrder` with an item ordering 10 units. Set its status to 'SENT'.
            *   [ ] Create an initial `Inventory` record for the product with quantity 0.
            *   [ ] Prepare the `items_received` data structure to receive 7 units.
        *   **Act:**
            *   [ ] `await test_core.inventory_manager.receive_purchase_order_items(...)`.
        *   **Assert:**
            *   [ ] Assert the result is a `Success`.
            *   [ ] Query the `PurchaseOrderItem` and assert `quantity_received` is now 7.
            *   [ ] Query the `PurchaseOrder` and assert its `status` is now 'PARTIALLY_RECEIVED'.
            *   [ ] Query the `Inventory` table and assert `quantity_on_hand` is now 7.
            *   [ ] Query the `StockMovement` table and assert a 'PURCHASE' record was created for +7 units.

*   **Test Case 5: `test_receive_more_than_ordered_fails`**
    *   **Goal:** Verify that attempting to receive more items than were ordered fails and rolls back the transaction.
    *   **Checklist (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
        *   **Arrange:**
            *   [ ] Create a `PurchaseOrder` for 10 units. Set status to 'SENT'.
            *   [ ] Create an `Inventory` record with quantity 0.
            *   [ ] Prepare `items_received` data to receive 11 units.
        *   **Act:**
            *   [ ] `await test_core.inventory_manager.receive_purchase_order_items(...)`.
        *   **Assert:**
            *   [ ] Assert the result is a `Failure`.
            *   [ ] Query the `PurchaseOrderItem` and assert `quantity_received` is still 0.
            *   [ ] Query the `Inventory` and assert `quantity_on_hand` is still 0.
            *   [ ] Query the `StockMovement` table and assert it is empty for this transaction.

**3. Code Generation & Validation**

I will now generate the complete `test_inventory_manager.py` file based on this detailed plan. It will use the same fixtures and patterns as the `test_sales_manager.py` file, ensuring consistency in the test suite. I will mentally review the generated code against the checklists to ensure all assertions are present and correct.

This is a robust plan to significantly increase test coverage on another critical part of the application's business logic. I will now proceed.Excellent. The `SalesManager` tests provide a solid foundation. I will now proceed with the next logical step in the plan for Phase 4.

### **Phase 4 Plan: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite**

**Previous Steps (Completed):**
*   **Sub-Task 4.1:** Test Fixture Setup.
*   **Sub-Task 4.2:** `SalesManager` Unit Tests.

**Current Step (To Be Executed):**
*   **Sub-Task 4.3:** `InventoryManager` Unit Tests.

---

### **Phase 4, Sub-Task 4.3: `InventoryManager` Unit Tests**

**Objective:** To create a suite of unit tests for the `InventoryManager`'s core methods. This will validate the logic for stock adjustments, purchase order creation, and the goods-receiving workflow, ensuring data integrity and correct stock level calculations.

**Execution Plan & Checklist:**

1.  **Create Test File:**
    *   [x] Create the new file: `tests/unit/business_logic/managers/test_inventory_manager.py`.
2.  **Implement Test Cases:**
    *   [x] **Stock Adjustments:** Write tests to confirm that adjustments correctly update inventory levels, log movements, and fail gracefully when an adjustment would result in negative stock.
    *   [x] **Purchase Order Creation:** Write a test to ensure that a `PurchaseOrder` and its line items are created correctly with the proper total value.
    *   [x] **Goods Receipt (Success):** Create a test for partially receiving items against a PO, and verify that the PO status, received quantity, inventory level, and stock movements are all updated correctly within a single transaction.
    *   [x] **Goods Receipt (Failure):** Create a test to verify that attempting to receive more items than were ordered results in a `Failure` and that the database state is completely rolled back, leaving inventory and PO statuses unchanged.
3.  **Utilize Fixtures:**
    *   [x] All tests will continue to use the `test_core` and `db_session` fixtures to ensure complete isolation.
    *   [x] `factory-boy` factories will be used to generate prerequisite data like products and suppliers.

All steps in this plan have been meticulously completed.
