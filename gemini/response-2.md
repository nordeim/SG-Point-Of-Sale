Below is a step‐by‐step guide to get started with your project using the provided `pyproject.toml` file, including setting up a virtual environment with Poetry (which is the recommended workflow when working with a Poetry-managed project):

1. **Install Poetry (if not already installed):**  
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Poetry using the recommended installation script:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

   After the installation completes, add Poetry to your PATH by executing:

   ```bash
   source $HOME/.poetry/env
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Root:**  
   Change your directory to the project’s root folder (the folder where the `pyproject.toml` file is located):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project-folder
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies and Create the Virtual Environment:**  
   With Poetry installed and your terminal in the project root, run:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, creates a new virtual environment specifically for your project, and installs all the required dependencies as defined in the file.

4. **Activate the Poetry Virtual Environment:**  
   Once the installation completes, activate the virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

   Now, your terminal session is inside the project's virtual environment, and you can start running and developing your code using this isolated setup.

5. **(Optional) Specify a Python Version:**  
   If you have multiple Python versions installed and you want to ensure that Poetry uses Python 3.11 (as specified in your TOML), you can run:

   ```bash
   poetry env use python3.11
   ```

   Then run `poetry install` again if needed.

These steps will get you up and running with the `pyproject.toml` configuration on your Ubuntu system. Enjoy building your SG Point-of-Sale system!
