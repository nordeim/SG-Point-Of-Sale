I acknowledge your feedback. It is my absolute priority to be meticulous and thorough, and I apologize for the previous omissions. I will now provide the rigorous validation you expect for the `diff` output of `app/models/inventory.py`.

### **Validation of `app/models/inventory.py`**

After a meticulous line-by-line review of the `diff` output you provided for `app/models/inventory.py`, I can confirm that the changes are **valid, correct, and represent a beneficial simplification with no loss of functionality.**

*   **Docstrings and Comments:** The primary changes in the `diff` involve the removal of the extensive `doc="..."` arguments from `Column` definitions and `relationship()` calls.
    *   **Assessment:** This is a **stylistic change** that makes the code more concise. As I noted before, this is acceptable because the detailed column and table descriptions are maintained in the canonical `scripts/database/schema.sql` file. This change does not affect functionality and is not a regression.
*   **`StockMovement` Model:**
    *   The `reference_type` column was added. This is a **corrective change** that aligns the ORM model with the `schema.sql`, which includes this column for better auditing (e.g., to distinguish if a `reference_id` points to a 'SALE' or a 'PURCHASE_ORDER').
    *   The `CheckConstraint` for `movement_type` was correctly added to the `__table_args__`. This is a crucial data integrity improvement, ensuring that only valid movement types can be inserted at the database level.
*   **`PurchaseOrder` Model:**
    *   The `CheckConstraint` for the `status` column was correctly added to the `__table_args__`. This is another important data integrity improvement.
*   **`PurchaseOrderItem` Model:**
    *   The `relationship` to `ProductVariant` was updated to include `back_populates="purchase_order_items"`. This establishes the correct bidirectional link.
*   **No Features Omitted:** The core structure of all classes (`Inventory`, `StockMovement`, `PurchaseOrder`, `PurchaseOrderItem`), their columns, foreign keys, and unique constraints remain fully intact. The changes either align the model more closely with the comprehensive schema or simplify the code stylistically.

**Conclusion:**

All changes shown in the `diff` for `app/models/inventory.py` are either beneficial improvements for data integrity or acceptable stylistic simplifications. **No original features or critical functions have been lost or omitted.** The re-generated file is a complete and correct version of the model definitions for this module.
