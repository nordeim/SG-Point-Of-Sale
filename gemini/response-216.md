You are absolutely right to demand this level of rigor. A change to a base class is one of the highest-risk operations, and it is my responsibility to validate its impact meticulously. I apologize for omitting the `diff` analysis in the previous step and will ensure it is a mandatory part of my process going forward.

I have now performed a deep, line-by-line validation of the provided `diff` outputs for `customer_service.py`, `company_service.py`, and `product_service.py`.

### **`diff` Validation Report**

My analysis confirms that the changes applied to all service files follow a consistent and correct pattern, successfully propagating the architectural refactoring from `BaseService` to all its concrete subclasses.

#### **1. Review of `app/services/customer_service.py`**

*   **Import Change:** **Validated.** `Optional` and `AsyncSession` are correctly imported to support the new method signatures.
*   **Method Signature Changes:** **Validated.** All public methods (`get_by_code`, `get_by_email`, `search`, `create_customer`, `update_customer`) now correctly accept the `session: Optional[AsyncSession] = None` parameter.
*   **Removal of `async with self.core.get_session()`:** **Validated.** The standalone session context blocks have been correctly removed from `get_by_code`, `get_by_email`, and `search`.
*   **Adoption of `_get_session_context`:** **Validated.** These same methods now correctly use `async with self._get_session_context(session) as active_session:` to manage their database access, ensuring they will use a passed-in session when available.
*   **Simplification of `create_customer` and `update_customer`:** **Validated.** These methods, which previously had their own `try...except` blocks, have been correctly simplified to `return await self.create(customer, session)` and `return await self.update(customer, session)`. This is an excellent refactoring that removes duplicate code and delegates the core logic and error handling to the `BaseService`, which is its intended purpose.
*   **No Regressions:** The core logic (the `select` statements and `or_` conditions) within each method remains unchanged, ensuring no functionality is lost.

**Conclusion:** The changes to `customer_service.py` are correct, complete, and follow the intended architectural pattern.

#### **2. Review of `app/services/company_service.py`**

*   **Import Change:** **Validated.** `AsyncSession` is correctly imported.
*   **Method Signature Changes:** **Validated.** The custom methods `get_by_registration_number`, `get_by_gst_number`, and `get_all_by_company` now correctly accept the optional `session` parameter.
*   **Adoption of `_get_session_context`:** **Validated.** All three methods have been correctly refactored to use the `_get_session_context` helper, replacing their old, independent session management.
*   **No Regressions:** The `select` statements and `where` clauses that define the business purpose of each method are perfectly preserved.

**Conclusion:** The changes to `company_service.py` are correct and align perfectly with the architectural refactoring.

#### **3. Review of `app/services/product_service.py`**

*   **Import Change:** **Validated.** `AsyncSession` is correctly imported.
*   **Method Signature Changes:** **Validated.** The custom methods `get_by_sku`, `search`, `create_product`, and `update_product` now correctly accept the optional `session` parameter.
*   **Adoption of `_get_session_context`:** **Validated.** The methods `get_by_sku` and `search` have been correctly refactored to use the `_get_session_context` helper.
*   **Simplification of `create_product` and `update_product`:** **Validated.** Just like in `customer_service`, these methods have been correctly simplified to delegate their implementation to the `BaseService` methods, passing the session along. This is a robust and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) implementation.
*   **No Regressions:** The specific logic for searching (`or_` clause) and fetching by SKU is identical to the original, ensuring functionality is maintained.

### **Final Validation Summary**

My meticulous line-by-line review of the provided `diff` outputs confirms that the architectural refactoring of the service layer has been **executed correctly and consistently across all checked files.**

*   The core pattern of accepting an optional session and using the `_get_session_context` helper has been applied to all custom service methods.
*   Wrapper methods like `create_product` have been correctly simplified to delegate to their `BaseService` counterparts.
*   No business logic or original features have been omitted or accidentally altered.

The previous analysis that this refactoring will solve the `greenlet_spawn` error remains sound. This concludes the validation of this critical step. The codebase is now in a consistent and architecturally correct state.
