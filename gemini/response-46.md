You are absolutely correct to call this out. I have failed again in my duty to be meticulous and to validate my own work before presenting it. The `diff` output you provided clearly shows that my previous generation of `app/core/application_core.py` was a significant regression, stripping out essential documentation, explicit type hinting, and robust logic in favor of an overly condensed and less readable version. This is unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize.

I am re-evaluating my internal generation process to ensure that when I claim to provide a "complete updated replacement file," it is a true, careful merge of existing, correct code with new additions, not a destructive rewrite.

### **Validation of `app/core/application_core.py`**

After a thorough review of the `diff` output you provided, I can confirm that the latest version (`+++`) is **invalid and represents a significant loss of quality and functionality.**

*   **Loss of Docstrings and Comments:** The `diff` shows the complete removal of all explanatory docstrings and comments. This makes the code's intent and structure opaque to developers, violating our principle of creating a maintainable and understandable codebase.
*   **Loss of Explicit Typing:** The new version removes explicit type hints from the `__init__` method (e.g., `_engine: Optional[AsyncEngine] = None`). This reduces the benefits of static analysis with MyPy and harms code clarity.
*   **Loss of Robust Logic:**
    *   The `initialize` method's `try...except` blocks were removed, eliminating specific, helpful exceptions like `DatabaseConnectionError` and `AsyncBridgeError`. The new version is less informative upon failure.
    *   The explicit check `if self._async_worker_thread.worker is None:` was removed, which was a good sanity check.
    *   The robust check for UUID validity was removed.
*   **Omission of Features:**
    *   The `payment_service` property was completely removed. Although `PaymentMethodService` is the primary one, having a separate `PaymentService` for the `Payment` model itself is a valid design choice for future needs, and its removal is an un-requested omission.
    *   The `role_service` property, which is crucial for the new `UserManager`, was omitted.
    *   The `company_manager` property was omitted.
    *   The `SET search_path` command was removed from `initialize`, which was a useful addition for ensuring schema context.
*   **Conclusion:** The changes are **invalid**. The generated file is a regression that damages code quality, reduces robustness, and omits necessary features.

I will now provide the **truly complete and correct** replacement file, which restores all the detailed, robust logic from the correct "previous" version and integrates the necessary new properties for Stage 5.

### **Phase 5.6: Final ApplicationCore and MainWindow Integration (Corrected)**

#### **1. `app/core/application_core.py` (Corrected and Final Version)**

*   **File Path:** `app/core/application_core.py`
*   **Purpose & Goals:** Final version with all services and managers integrated as lazy-loaded properties, with full docstrings, comments, and robust initialization logic preserved.
*   **Interfaces:** Exposes all service and manager properties for the entire application.
*   **Interactions:** Serves as the central DI container for the entire application.
*   **Code Skeleton (Complete updated replacement file):**

```python
# File: app/core/application_core.py
"""
The heart of the application's architecture: The Dependency Injection Container.

The ApplicationCore class is a singleton-like object responsible for creating,
managing, and providing access to all major application services and managers.
It uses a lazy-initialization pattern to ensure resources are only created when
they are first needed.
