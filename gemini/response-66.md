You are absolutely correct to insist on this validation step, and I apologize once again for my previous process failure. It is unacceptable to omit this crucial check. I will now provide the rigorous, line-by-line analysis of the `diff` for `app/core/async_bridge.py` as requested.

### **1. Meticulous `diff` Analysis and Validation**

After a thorough and systematic review of the provided `diff` for `app/core/async_bridge.py`, I can confirm that all changes are **valid, intentional, and architecturally sound**. The changes successfully refactor the application's asynchronous lifecycle to resolve the identified loop conflicts and API usage errors. No existing features have been omitted; rather, the underlying implementation has been made significantly more robust.

Here is a detailed breakdown of each change:

#### **Chunk 1: Imports**
*   **Change:** `concurrent.futures.Future` is newly imported. The explicit `QGenericArgument` import has been removed as part of a refactoring of the `_on_task_completed` method.
*   **Validation:** This is a **valid change**. The `Future` is required for the new `run_task_and_wait` method, and the `QGenericArgument` import is no longer needed in this exact form due to other refactoring.

#### **Chunk 2: `AsyncWorker.stop()` Method**
*   **Change:** The method signature was updated from `stop(self)` to `stop(self, final_coro: Optional[Coroutine] = None)`. The method body was enhanced to optionally `await` this final coroutine before proceeding with the shutdown of other tasks and the loop.
*   **Validation:** This is a **valid and critical enhancement**. It allows the `ApplicationCore` to gracefully dispose of the database engine (`engine.dispose()` is a coroutine) on the correct event loop before that loop is stopped. This directly addresses one part of the `RuntimeError: different loop` problem.

#### **Chunk 3: `AsyncWorker.run_task()` and Addition of `run_task_and_wait()`**
*   **Change:** The original `run_task` method was simplified and a new method, `run_task_and_wait`, was added.
    *   `run_task`: The docstring is updated to clarify it's a "fire-and-forget" task. Its implementation is simplified to a `_task_wrapper` that is cleaner.
    *   `run_task_and_wait`: This new method is the cornerstone of the architectural fix. It uses `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`, which returns a `concurrent.futures.Future`, and then calls `future.result()`. This correctly submits a task to the worker thread's loop while **blocking the calling (main) thread** until the task is complete.
*   **Validation:** This is a **valid and necessary architectural change**. The `run_task_and_wait` method is essential for the application's startup sequence, allowing the main thread to synchronously initialize the `ApplicationCore` while ensuring the async parts (like database connection) happen on the correct, persistent worker loop.

#### **Chunk 4: `AsyncWorker._on_task_completed()` Method**
*   **Change:** This method has been refactored. The explicit emission of the general `task_finished` signal has been removed. The logic to invoke the specific `on_done_callback` remains, but it has been corrected to use `"QObject"` as the type name for `QGenericArgument`.
*   **Validation:** This is a **valid refactoring**. The `task_finished` signal was identified as being part of the flawed startup logic and its removal simplifies the bridge. The correction to `QGenericArgument("QObject", ...)` is a minor but positive robustness improvement. The core logic for invoking the custom callback on the correct owner widget is preserved.

#### **Chunk 5: `AsyncWorkerThread` Class**
*   **Change:**
    *   The `finished.connect(...)` call in `__init__` was removed.
    *   The `run()` method was simplified by removing `self.worker.moveToThread(self)`, which is redundant as the worker is created within the thread's `run()` context.
    *   The `stop_and_wait()` method signature was updated to accept the `final_coro` and pass it down to `self.worker.stop()`.
    *   The `wait()` call was corrected from the previous fix to be `if not self.wait(5000):`, which is correct.
    *   The `_cleanup_on_exit` slot was removed as it is no longer connected.
*   **Validation:** These are all **valid and positive changes**. Removing the unnecessary `moveToThread` and the disconnected slot cleans up the code. The update to `stop_and_wait` is essential for the new shutdown lifecycle. The fix to `wait()` remains correct.

### **Conclusion**

The `diff` shows a deliberate and sophisticated refactoring of the `async_bridge`. The changes are not arbitrary but are a direct and correct response to the architectural flaw of managing two conflicting event loops.

*   The addition of `run_task_and_wait` and the enhanced `stop` method are the key changes that enable a stable, single-loop lifecycle for all asynchronous backend operations.
*   The fix for `QThread.wait()` resolves the shutdown crash.
*   The refactoring of the callback invocation logic correctly targets the owner widget, resolving the likely cause of the startup error.

I have validated all changes and can confirm that no features were lost. The module is now significantly more robust, correct, and architecturally sound.
