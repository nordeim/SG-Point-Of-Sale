## **1. Introduction: What is SG-POS?**

**SG-POS** is a free and open-source Point-of-Sale system, engineered from the ground up to address the specific operational and regulatory challenges faced by Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) in Singapore. It aims to provide the power and polish of expensive enterprise systems in an accessible, modern, and maintainable package.

This project is built with an obsessive focus on quality, both in the user experience and, most importantly, in the engineering. It serves not only as a functional tool but also as a reference implementation for professional-grade Python application architecture, featuring a non-blocking UI, a clean, layered design, and robust data integrity practices. The system is designed to be the central hub for a retail business, managing everything from the customer-facing checkout process to backend inventory control, procurement, and financial reporting.

The codebase has recently undergone a significant architectural hardening to resolve a series of subtle but critical asynchronous bugs. The resulting system is now exceptionally stable, with a data access layer that correctly handles atomic transactions and prevents the UI-freezing issues that can plague complex desktop applications.

## **3. Architectural Deep Dive**

SG-POS is built on a set of robust architectural principles designed for maintainability and scalability.

### **3.1 The Layered Architecture**

Our architecture strictly separates the application into four logical layers, ensuring that each part of the codebase has a single, well-defined responsibility. This design was instrumental in diagnosing and fixing the recent complex bugs, as it allowed for targeted analysis of each layer's responsibilities.

1.  **Presentation Layer (`app/ui`):** Built with PySide6, this layer is responsible *only* for what the user sees and how they interact with it. It contains no business logic. When a user acts, the UI packages the input into a DTO and hands it to the Business Logic Layer via the application's core.

2.  **Business Logic Layer (`app/business_logic`):** The brain of the application. **Managers** (e.g., `SalesManager`) orchestrate workflows, enforce business rules, and make decisions. They use **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) as clean data contracts for communication with the UI.

3.  **Data Access Layer (`app/services`):** Implements the **Repository Pattern**. It provides a clean, abstract API for all database operations, hiding SQL complexity. Each service (e.g., `ProductService`) is responsible for querying a specific database entity. After the recent refactoring, all service methods are fully **transaction-aware**, allowing them to participate safely in larger units of work controlled by the managers.

4.  **Persistence Layer (`app/models`):** Defines the database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM models, which map directly to the PostgreSQL tables. This is the only layer aware of the database's table and column structure.

### **3.2 Module Interaction Flowchart**

The flow of control and data is unidirectional and decoupled, ensuring a responsive UI and testable components. The `ApplicationCore` acts as a Dependency Injection (DI) container, providing services and managers to the components that need them. The following diagram illustrates the flow for finalizing a sale, showcasing the robust, multi-layered approach.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Main Thread (GUI)"
        direction LR
        A[User clicks 'Finalize Sale' in PaymentDialog] --> B[Presentation Layer<br>POSView & PaymentDialog];
        B --> C{Async Bridge<br>app/core/async_bridge.py};
        H[UI Callback _on_done] --> I[Update UI<br>Show 'Sale Completed' message];
    end

    subgraph "Worker Thread (Backend)"
        direction TB
        D[Business Logic Layer<br>app/business_logic/managers/sales_manager.py] -- Calls --> E[Inventory & Customer Managers];
        D -- Calls --> F[Data Access Layer<br>app/services/sales_service.py];
        F -- Uses ORM Models --> G[Persistence Layer<br>app/models/sales.py];
    end
    
    subgraph "Database Server"
        J[(PostgreSQL Database)];
    end

    subgraph "Core Components (DI)"
        K[ApplicationCore<br>app/core/application_core.py];
    end

    %% Flow of Control and Data
    C -- "1. Submits 'finalize_sale' Coroutine" --> D;
    K -- "Provides Service/Manager Dependencies" --> D;
    E -- "Coordinates stock deduction & loyalty points" --> D;
    G -- "Maps to Tables" --> J;
    F -- "2. Executes Atomic Transaction (INSERTs/UPDATEs)" --> J;
    J -- "3. Returns Persisted Records" --> F;
    F -- "4. Returns ORM Models" --> D;
    D -- "5. Wraps Result in FinalizedSaleDTO" --> C;
    C -- "6. Emits 'callback_ready' Signal to Main Thread" --> H;

    style A fill:#cde4ff
    style I fill:#d5e8d4
```

This flow guarantees that the UI (main thread) is never blocked. The `Async Bridge` offloads the heavy work (steps D, E, F, G, J) to a background thread, and the UI is only updated via a safe callback once all the work is complete. The recent bug fixes perfected this flow, especially in step D, ensuring that all data for the final DTO is prepared safely before step C is signaled.

## **6. Developer & Deployment Guide**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a complete local development environment for the SG-POS application from scratch. It covers both the database server and the POS application itself.

### **6.1 Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
*   **Python 3.11+:** The application is built on modern Python features. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Poetry:** For managing dependencies and the virtual environment. [Official Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** To easily run the PostgreSQL database in a container. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### **6.2 Step 1: Database Server Setup (Docker)**

The database is run as a containerized service using Docker, which simplifies setup and ensures a consistent environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired workspace directory, and clone the project from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/sg-pos-system.git
    cd sg-pos-system
    ```

2.  **Configure the Environment**
    The application and Docker service read configuration from a `.env.dev` file. Copy the provided template to create your local version. The default values are pre-configured to work together.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.dev
    ```
    *Note: For production, you would create a separate `.env.production` file with strong, unique passwords and keys.*

3.  **Start the Database Container**
    This command starts the PostgreSQL database server in the background. Docker will automatically pull the `postgres:16-alpine` image if you don't have it locally.
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
    ```
    To verify the database is running, use `docker ps`. You should see a container named `sgpos_dev_db`.

### **6.3 Step 2: POS Application Setup**

With the database server running, you can now set up and run the Python application.

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    From the project's root directory (`sg-pos-system/`), run the following command. Poetry will create a dedicated virtual environment and install all necessary packages defined in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    To use the installed packages, you must activate the virtual environment. All subsequent commands in the terminal must be run inside this shell.
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```
    Your command prompt should now be prefixed with the environment name (e.g., `(sg-pos-system-py3.11)`).

3.  **Apply Database Migrations**
    This is a **critical first-time step**. It connects to the running PostgreSQL container and uses Alembic to create all the necessary tables, indexes, and constraints. The corrected initial migration file ensures the schema is created perfectly.
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

4.  **Seed Initial Data**
    A fresh database is empty. This script populates it with the essential data required to run the application, including the default company, an admin user, and the main outlet.
    ```bash
    python scripts/database/seed_data.py
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    You are now ready to launch the SG-POS system. The main window should appear, fully functional.
    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

## **7. Running the Test Suite**

A key feature of this codebase is its comprehensive and reliable test suite. Running the tests is a critical step to ensure that your changes have not introduced any regressions.

*   **Run all tests:** To ensure the entire application logic is sound, run the following command from the project root (inside the `poetry shell`):
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    This will discover and run all tests in the `tests/` directory against an isolated, in-memory SQLite database, providing fast and reliable feedback.

*   **Check Test Coverage:** To see which parts of the application are covered by tests, you can generate a report in your terminal or as a more detailed HTML report:
    ```bash
    # For a quick summary in the terminal
    pytest --cov=app

    # For a detailed, browsable HTML report
    pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
    ```
    After running the second command, open the generated `htmlcov/index.html` file in your browser to explore coverage line by line.

## **8. User Guide: Running the Application**

Once the application is running, here is a brief guide on how to use its core features:

*   **Navigation:** Use the menu bar at the top of the window (`Dashboard`, `POS`, `Data Management`, etc.) to switch between the different sections of the application. The application uses lazy-loading, so views are only created the first time you navigate to them, ensuring a fast startup.
*   **Dashboard:** The Dashboard is the first view you might want to check. Navigate via `Dashboard > Show Dashboard`. It provides a live look at today's sales, transaction counts, and other key metrics. It automatically refreshes with the latest data each time you view it.
*   **Making a Sale:**
    1.  Navigate to `POS > Sales Screen`. This is the default view on startup.
    2.  Use the product search bar to find an item by its SKU or name and click **"Add to Cart"**. The item will appear in the cart on the left.
    3.  Once all items are added, click the green **"PAY"** button.
    4.  In the `Process Payment` dialog, select a payment method, enter the amount tendered, and click **"Add Payment"**. You can add multiple payments for split-tender transactions.
    5.  Once the balance is zero or less, click **"Finalize Sale"**. A success message will appear, and the cart will be cleared for the next transaction.
*   **Managing Data (Products, Customers, etc.):**
    1.  Navigate to a management screen like `Data Management > Products`.
    2.  The view will show a "Loading..." message and then display the data. If no data exists, it will show an informative "No products found" message. This stateful feedback is consistent across all data views.
    3.  Use the **"Add New"**, **"Edit Selected"**, and **"Deactivate Selected"** buttons to manage records. Double-clicking a row is a shortcut for editing.
*   **Settings:**
    1.  Navigate to `Settings > Application Settings`.
    2.  Here you can manage Company Information, add or edit Users and their roles, and manage Payment Methods.

## **9. Project Roadmap**

With the core features and UI/UX baseline established, the project is well-positioned for future growth.

### **9.1 Immediate Next Steps (v1.1+)**

*   **Expand Test Coverage:** Continue to build out the test suite, focusing on the data access (service) layer and adding basic UI tests with `pytest-qt` to validate signal/slot connections and dialog behavior.
*   **Advanced Promotions Module:** Implement logic for complex discounts (e.g., "Buy One Get One", tiered discounts, customer-group-specific pricing). This would involve new models and a dedicated `PromotionManager`.
*   **Global Status Bar:** Add a `QStatusBar` to the `MainWindow` to provide non-intrusive feedback for operations like saving data or connection status, improving the user's awareness of background activities.
*   **Refine Dashboard:** Add more KPIs and simple charts (e.g., a bar chart for weekly sales) to the dashboard. This would involve enhancing the `ReportService` with more aggregation queries.
*   **Improve Search UX:** Implement the debouncing `QTimer` pattern (currently in `ProductView` and `CustomerView`) across all other searchable views (`InventoryView`) to improve performance and reduce database load.

### **9.2 Long-Term Vision (v2.0+)**

*   **Multi-Location Inventory:** Build features for transferring stock between different outlets, including transfer orders and in-transit tracking. This would require significant additions to the `InventoryManager` and new UI views.
*   **Full Accounting Module:** Expand the accounting models to support a full double-entry ledger, accounts payable/receivable, and automated journal entries from sales and purchases. This would transform the application into a lightweight ERP system.
*   **E-commerce Connector:** Develop an integration with platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce to sync products, orders, and inventory levels in real-time. This would likely involve creating a new `integrations` sub-package.
*   **Cloud Backend:** Architect a cloud-based version of the backend logic, exposing it via a REST or GraphQL API. This would enable the creation of a mobile companion app (for stock-takes or mobile sales) and a web-based reporting dashboard for business owners to access from anywhere.
*   **Enhanced Hardware Support:** Add direct support for receipt printers, cash drawers, and barcode scanners using libraries that interface with serial or USB ports.
