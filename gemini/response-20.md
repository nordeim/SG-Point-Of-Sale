I acknowledge your feedback. My commitment is to deliver solutions with the highest level of diligence and meticulous problem-solving. I apologize deeply for the persistence of errors and the frustration this process is causing. This is not the standard of precision I strive for.

You are now facing a new error: `sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet: greenlet_spawn has not been called; can't call await_only() here. Was IO attempted in an unexpected place?`. This error is very specific to SQLAlchemy's `asyncio` integration and how it manages asynchronous operations.

**Deep Dive Analysis & Thorough Exploration of Options:**

This error means that SQLAlchemy's `asyncio` dialect (which `postgresql+asyncpg` uses) is trying to execute an asynchronous operation (like connecting to the database) in a synchronous context, or in a context where its internal greenlet (a lightweight coroutine) is not properly managed.

The traceback shows this happens when `connectable.connect()` is called within `run_migrations_online()` in `migrations/env.py`. This is where Alembic tries to establish a database connection to perform the autogeneration by inspecting the live database.

**Why this is happening:**
Alembic's `run_migrations_online()` function, by default, runs in a synchronous Python context. However, our `sqlalchemy.url` is `postgresql+asyncpg://...`, which uses the `asyncpg` driver, an asynchronous driver. SQLAlchemy's `asyncio` support requires all database I/O to be run within an `asyncio` event loop and explicitly wrapped by `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio.async_support.greenlet_spawn` (or implicitly by `await_only`). Since Alembic's `env.py` is a synchronous script, it doesn't naturally provide this `asyncio` context.

**Exploring Implementation Options to fix `MissingGreenlet`:**

1.  **Change `sqlalchemy.url` to a synchronous driver:**
    *   **Option 1.1:** Change `postgresql+asyncpg` to `postgresql+psycopg2` (or `postgresql` directly if `psycopg2` is the default).
    *   **Pros:** Simplest fix, directly addresses the sync/async mismatch. `psycopg2` is the traditional synchronous PostgreSQL driver.
    *   **Cons:** Our application (`ApplicationCore`) is designed to be fully asynchronous using `asyncpg`. Switching Alembic to a synchronous driver would mean `alembic.ini` has a different driver setup than the application. While generally harmless (Alembic is a dev tool), it's a slight inconsistency. It also requires `psycopg2-binary` to be installed.
    *   **Decision:** This is a very common and practical solution for Alembic, as migrations themselves are usually synchronous operations that don't need the performance benefits of async I/O.

2.  **Run `run_migrations_online` within an `asyncio` loop:**
    *   **Option 2.1:** Modify `env.py` to wrap the `run_migrations_online()` call in `asyncio.run()`.
        ```python
        def run_migrations_online() -> None:
            # ...
            async def do_run_migrations():
                connectable = engine_from_config(...)
                async with connectable.connect() as connection:
                    # ... context.configure ...
                    context.run_migrations()
            asyncio.run(do_run_migrations())
        ```
    *   **Pros:** Keeps Alembic aligned with `asyncpg` driver.
    *   **Cons:** Alembic's `env.py` is inherently synchronous, and wrapping the entire connection process in `asyncio.run` can lead to deeper compatibility issues or unexpected behavior with how Alembic itself manages contexts and external processes. SQLAlchemy's `asyncio` integration is primarily for the application's runtime, not typically for tools like Alembic which interact with synchronous `ConfigParser` and `sys` modules. `engine_from_config` itself might not be fully async-aware, or its interaction with `connectable.connect()` requires careful setup. This approach is more complex and fragile.

3.  **Use `run_sync` with `NullPool` (for `asyncpg` only):**
    *   For `asyncpg`, SQLAlchemy provides a `sync_engine` property that uses `greenlet_spawn` internally to allow synchronous-like interaction. This is typically used within the application, but could theoretically be adapted here.
    *   **Pros:** Maintains `asyncpg` driver.
    *   **Cons:** Still complex, and `env.py` isn't running in a greenlet-aware context by default. The `MissingGreenlet` error explicitly states `greenlet_spawn has not been called`.

**Chosen Optimal Solution:**

**Option 1.1: Switch Alembic's driver to `postgresql+psycopg2` (synchronous) in `migrations/env.py`.**

This is the most straightforward, stable, and widely recommended solution for running Alembic migrations with a PostgreSQL database when the application itself uses an asynchronous driver like `asyncpg`. Migrations are not typically performance-sensitive, so the overhead of a synchronous driver is negligible. This completely bypasses the `MissingGreenlet` error by removing the need for an `asyncio` context where one isn't naturally provided.

**Pre-requisite:** We need to ensure `psycopg2-binary` (or `psycopg2`) is installed. Our `pyproject.toml` doesn't explicitly list it. So, it needs to be added as a dependency.

**Detailed Execution Plan to fix:**

1.  **Modify `pyproject.toml`:**
    *   **File Path:** `pyproject.toml`
    *   **Purpose & Goals:** Add `psycopg2-binary` as a dependency for development.
    *   **Interactions:** Poetry will install this package.
    *   **Code Skeleton (Complete updated replacement file):**

**Summary and Conclusion of Task Completion:**

I have thoroughly analyzed the `sqlalchemy.exc.MissingGreenlet` error. This error stems from Alembic's synchronous execution context attempting to use an asynchronous database driver (`asyncpg`) directly.

**Optimal Solution Chosen:**
The most robust and common practice for this scenario is to configure Alembic to use a **synchronous PostgreSQL driver** (`psycopg2`) for its migration operations, while allowing the main application to continue using `asyncpg`. This avoids the async/sync mismatch without complicating Alembic's core execution flow.

**Execution Steps to Resolve:**

1.  **Update `pyproject.toml`:** Added `psycopg2-binary` to `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` to ensure the synchronous driver is available in the development environment.
2.  **Run `poetry install`:** You must execute `poetry install` manually on your system after updating `pyproject.toml` to install this new dependency.
3.  **Update `migrations/env.py`:** Modified the script to:
    *   Detect if the `DATABASE_URL` uses `postgresql+asyncpg`.
    *   Dynamically replace the `postgresql+asyncpg` part with `postgresql+psycopg2` to create `alembic_db_url`.
    *   Use this `alembic_db_url` when configuring Alembic's database connection in both `run_migrations_online()` and `run_migrations_offline()`.

This carefully designed solution ensures the database connection for Alembic is compatible with its synchronous runtime environment, directly addressing the `MissingGreenlet` error.

Please perform the `poetry install` command after updating `pyproject.toml`, then replace your `migrations/env.py` file with the content above, and finally, retry the `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema setup"` command.
