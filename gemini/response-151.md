The application log is clean, and the new dashboard functionality is executing correctly. The log shows the new queries from `get_dashboard_stats_raw_data` being run successfully when the Dashboard view is displayed. It also shows SQLAlchemy's query caching (`cached since...`) kicking in on the second visit, which is excellent for performance. The application is stable.

We have successfully completed Phase 3. The Dashboard feature is now structurally in place, with a functional backend and a presentational UI.

I will now outline the detailed plan for the final phase of this series of enhancements.

### **Phase 4 Plan: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite**

**Goal:** To significantly increase the reliability and maintainability of the application by creating a foundational suite of automated tests. This is the highest priority for ensuring long-term quality and preventing regressions.

**High-Level Strategy:**
We will focus on creating **unit tests** for the business logic layer. This provides the highest return on investment, as it validates the core rules and data transformations of the application in isolation, making the tests fast and reliable. We will start with the most critical and complex manager: `SalesManager`.

**New File Structure for this Phase:**
```
tests/
├── conftest.py                   # Updated File
└── unit/
    └── business_logic/
        └── managers/
            └── test_sales_manager.py   # New File
```

### **Phase 4, Sub-Task 4.1: Test Fixture Setup**

**Objective:** To prepare the testing environment by creating reusable test fixtures. Fixtures are a powerful `pytest` feature for providing a fixed baseline of data and objects for tests.

**Execution Plan & Checklist:**

1.  **Update `pyproject.toml`:**
    *   [ ] Add `pytest-asyncio` to the `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` to enable testing of our `async` code. *(Self-correction: I see this is already present in the file, so no change is needed. My validation confirms the project is already equipped for this task.)*
2.  **Update `tests/conftest.py`:**
    *   [ ] **In-Memory Database Fixture:** Create a `pytest` fixture that sets up an in-memory SQLite database for testing. This makes tests extremely fast and completely isolated from the production Docker database. The fixture will:
        *   Configure Alembic programmatically to use the SQLite database URL.
        *   Run `alembic upgrade head` to create the schema.
        *   Yield the database engine or session factory to the tests.
        *   Clean up the database after the test session.
    *   [ ] **`ApplicationCore` Fixture:** Create a fixture that provides a fully initialized `ApplicationCore` instance connected to the in-memory test database. This will be the primary tool for testing managers.
    *   [ ] **Data Fixtures with `factory-boy`:** Create factories to generate realistic test data (e.g., `ProductFactory`, `CustomerFactory`). This avoids hardcoding data in every test.
        *   The `factory-boy` library is already a dependency, so we will leverage it. We will create a `factories.py` file to house these.

---
### **Phase 4, Sub-Task 4.2: `SalesManager` Unit Tests**

**Objective:** To write the first and most critical set of unit tests for the `SalesManager.finalize_sale` method, covering both success and failure scenarios.

**Execution Plan & Checklist:**

1.  **Create Test File:**
    *   [ ] Create a new file: `tests/unit/business_logic/managers/test_sales_manager.py`.
2.  **Implement Test Cases:**
    *   [ ] **`test_finalize_sale_success`:**
        *   Use the test fixtures to get a test `ApplicationCore` and create prerequisite data (products, user, payment methods) using the factories.
        *   Construct a valid `SaleCreateDTO`.
        *   Call `sales_manager.finalize_sale()`.
        *   Assert that the result is a `Success` instance.
        *   Assert that the returned `FinalizedSaleDTO` has the correct total, change due, etc.
        *   Assert that the `Inventory` level for the sold product has been correctly reduced.
        *   Assert that `SalesTransaction`, `SalesTransactionItem`, and `Payment` records were created in the test database.
    *   [ ] **`test_finalize_sale_insufficient_payment`:**
        *   Create a `SaleCreateDTO` where the payment amount is less than the total.
        *   Call `sales_manager.finalize_sale()`.
        *   Assert that the result is a `Failure` instance.
        *   Assert that no `SalesTransaction` or `StockMovement` records were created in the database, verifying transactional rollback.
    *   [ ] **`test_finalize_sale_insufficient_stock`:**
        *   Set up a product with a known stock level (e.g., 5 units).
        *   Create a `SaleCreateDTO` that attempts to sell more than the available stock (e.g., 10 units).
        *   Call `sales_manager.finalize_sale()`.
        *   Assert that the result is a `Failure` instance and the error message mentions insufficient stock.
        *   Assert that the database state remains unchanged.

I will now begin with **Sub-Task 4.1**, preparing the test environment.

### **Generated and Updated Files for Sub-Task 4.1**

#### 1. New File: `tests/factories.py`
This file will house our `factory-boy` factories for creating test model instances.

```python

    class Meta:
        model = Company
        sqlalchemy_session = Session
