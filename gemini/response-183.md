### **CodeNavigator's Deep Thought Process**

**1. Deconstruct the User's Request**

*   **Primary Goal:** The user has repeated the same request to create a complete, updated `README.md`. This indicates my previous response for the `README.md` was likely not seen or was part of a context that has now been reset. I must not assume the user has seen my prior `README.md` generation.
*   **Source Material:** The original `README (draft to be updated).md` file, and all the knowledge I have gained from the entire development and debugging cycle.
*   **Output:** A single, complete "replacement" `README.md` file. It must be self-contained and not reference older versions. The user has also mistakenly mentioned a `Technical Design Specification Document.md`, but the core request is clearly about the `README.md`. I will focus on the `README.md` as that is the consistent part of the prompt.
*   **Key Requirements (Re-validated):** The list of six requirements is identical to the previous request. I must ensure all six are fully and accurately addressed.
    1.  File hierarchy diagram.
    2.  Interaction flowchart diagram.
    3.  File descriptions.
    4.  Features and Roadmap.
    5.  Deployment Guide.
    6.  User Guide.
*   **Implicit Requirements:**
    *   The README must reflect the **final, working state** of the codebase, including the new Dashboard, the Payment Methods UI, the `ManagedTableView` UX enhancement, and the now-functional test suite.
    *   The tone must remain professional and informative.

**2. Architecture and Content Planning for the README.md**

My previous plan for the `README.md` structure was sound and comprehensive. I will reuse that structure but will refine the content to be even more accurate and detailed based on the successfully implemented features.

**Revised/Refined Structure:**

1.  **Header:** Title, updated screenshot (showing the new Dashboard), badges.
2.  **Introduction:** "What is SG-POS?" - Re-using the strong introductory text.
3.  **Current Features & Status:** A detailed table reflecting the now-complete features. I will update the "Notes" to be more descriptive.
4.  **Architectural Deep Dive:** This remains a critical section.
    *   **The Layered Architecture:** I will explain the four layers clearly.
    *   **Module Interaction Flowchart:** I will use the `finalize_sale` workflow as the example in the Mermaid diagram, as it's the most comprehensive.
5.  **Codebase Deep Dive:**
    *   **Project File Hierarchy:** A tree diagram. I will generate this based on the final file structure, now including the new test files and UI widgets.
    *   **Key File & Directory Descriptions:** A table explaining each component's purpose.
6.  **Technology Stack:** I'll review `pyproject.toml` one last time to ensure the list is complete, now including `greenlet` and `aiosqlite`.
7.  **Developer Setup & Deployment Guide:** This must be perfect and foolproof.
    *   Prerequisites.
    *   Step-by-step commands. I will ensure the `poetry install` command is highlighted as it's now critical for installing the new test dependencies.
8.  **Running the Test Suite:** Since a major part of our work was creating the test suite, the README should absolutely contain a section on how to run it. I will adapt the content from the `project_test_guide.md` I just created. This adds significant value for new developers.
9.  **User Guide:** Clear, simple instructions for end-users on core workflows.
10. **Project Roadmap:** Synthesize the next steps. I will add "Continue expanding test coverage" as a high-priority item in the immediate roadmap.
11. **Contributing & License:** Standard sections linking to the relevant files.

**3. Content Generation - Refinements and Additions**

*   **Screenshot:** I will mentally replace the old screenshot with the new one showing the Dashboard view, as it's more impressive and reflects the latest work.
*   **Features & Status Table:** I will update the table to reflect that the Dashboard and Payment Method configuration are now fully functional.
*   **Flowchart:** The previous flowchart was good. I will reuse it as it accurately depicts the architecture.
*   **File Hierarchy:** I must ensure the new files are included:
    *   `app/business_logic/dto/payment_dto.py`
    *   `app/business_logic/managers/payment_manager.py`
    *   `app/ui/dialogs/payment_method_dialog.py`
    *   `app/ui/views/payment_method_view.py`
    *   `app/ui/views/dashboard_view.py`
    *   `app/ui/widgets/kpi_widget.py`
    *   `app/ui/widgets/managed_table_view.py`
    *   All the new files under `tests/`.
*   **Technology Stack Table:** I will add `greenlet` and `aiosqlite` to the table to reflect the final state of `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Deployment Guide:** The steps are now well-tested and validated. I will present them clearly. I will add a crucial note about what `poetry install` does (installing *all* dependencies, including dev ones).
*   **New Section: Running the Test Suite:** This is a major value-add. I will include subsections for running all tests, specific tests, and checking coverage. This demonstrates the project's commitment to quality.
*   **Roadmap:** The roadmap will be updated to reflect the completion of the Dashboard and UX enhancements. The next logical steps would be things like the Promotions Module and expanding test coverage to the UI layer.

**4. Final Review**

I will perform a final, meticulous check of the entire generated document.
*   **Completeness:** All 6 requirements are met, plus the new "Running the Test Suite" section.
*   **Accuracy:** The content reflects the *final* state of the codebase after all our iterative fixes.
*   **Clarity:** The language is clear, professional, and accessible to a new developer.
*   **Self-Contained:** No references to previous versions or external documents other than the standard `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.
*   **Formatting:** All Markdown elements (tables, code blocks, diagrams) are correctly formatted.

This comprehensive plan ensures I will generate the highest quality `README.md` that fully captures the excellent state of the project we have achieved together. I will now proceed with the generation.Of course. After a thorough and successful cycle of enhancements and fixes, it is essential to update the primary project documentation to reflect the current, high-quality state of the codebase. I will now generate a complete and accurate replacement for the `README.md` file.

This document is written from a fresh perspective, incorporating all new features like the Dashboard and Payment Methods UI, the significant UI/UX architectural improvements with the `ManagedTableView`, and the now-functional comprehensive test suite. It is designed to be the definitive entry point for any developer or user engaging with the project.

## **3. Architectural Deep Dive**

SG-POS is built on a set of robust architectural principles designed for maintainability and scalability.

### The Layered Architecture

Our architecture strictly separates the application into four logical layers, ensuring that each part of the codebase has a single, well-defined responsibility:

1.  **Presentation Layer (`app/ui`):** Built with PySide6, this layer is responsible *only* for what the user sees and how they interact with it. It contains no business logic. When a user acts, the UI packages the input into a DTO and hands it to the Business Logic Layer via the application's core.

2.  **Business Logic Layer (`app/business_logic`):** The brain of the application. **Managers** (e.g., `SalesManager`) orchestrate workflows, enforce business rules, and make decisions. They use **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) as clean data contracts for communication with the UI.

3.  **Data Access Layer (`app/services`):** Implements the **Repository Pattern**. It provides a clean, abstract API for all database operations, hiding SQL complexity. Each service (e.g., `ProductService`) is responsible for querying a specific database entity.

4.  **Persistence Layer (`app/models`):** Defines the database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM models, which map directly to the PostgreSQL tables. This is the only layer aware of the database's table and column structure.

### Module Interaction Flowchart

The flow of control and data is unidirectional and decoupled, ensuring a responsive UI and testable components. The `ApplicationCore` acts as a Dependency Injection (DI) container, providing services and managers to the components that need them. The following diagram illustrates the flow for finalizing a sale.

```mermaid

## **6. Developer Setup & Deployment Guide**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a complete local development environment for the SG-POS application from scratch.

### Prerequisites

*   **Git:** For version control. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
*   **Python 3.11+:** Make sure it's installed and available in your system's `PATH`. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Poetry:** For managing dependencies. See the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** To run the PostgreSQL database in a container. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/sg-pos-system.git
    cd sg-pos-system
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Copy the example environment file. The default values are suitable for the local Docker setup.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.dev
    ```

3.  **Start the Database Server**
    This command downloads the PostgreSQL image and starts the database container in the background. It will be available on `localhost:5432`.
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
    ```

4.  **Install Project Dependencies**
    This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, creates a dedicated virtual environment, and installs all production and development packages (like `pytest` and `aiosqlite`).
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

5.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    All subsequent commands must be run inside this environment to use the installed packages.
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

6.  **Apply Database Migrations**
    This command connects to the running PostgreSQL database and creates all the necessary tables within the `sgpos` schema.
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

7.  **Seed Initial Data (Crucial First-Time Step)**
    This script populates the fresh database with the default company, admin user, roles, and outlet needed to run the application.
    ```bash
    python scripts/database/seed_data.py
    ```

8.  **Run the Application**
    You are now ready to launch the POS system.
    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

## 7. Running the Test Suite
A key feature of this codebase is its comprehensive and reliable test suite.

- **Run all tests:** To ensure the entire application logic is sound, run the following command from the project root (inside the `poetry shell`):
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Check Test Coverage:** To see which parts of the application are covered by tests, generate an HTML report:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
  # Then open the generated htmlcov/index.html in your browser.
  ```

## **8. User Guide: Running the Application**

Once the application is running, here is a brief guide on how to use its core features:

*   **Navigation:** Use the menu bar at the top of the window (`Dashboard`, `POS`, `Data Management`, etc.) to switch between the different sections.
*   **Dashboard:** The Dashboard view is now available and provides a live look at today's sales, transaction counts, and other key metrics. It automatically refreshes each time you view it.
*   **Making a Sale:**

## **9. Project Roadmap**

With the core features and UI/UX baseline established, the project is well-positioned for future growth.

### Immediate Next Steps (v1.1)

*   **Expand Test Coverage:** Continue to build out the test suite, focusing on the data access (service) layer and adding basic UI tests with `pytest-qt`.
*   **Advanced Promotions Module:** Implement logic for complex discounts (e.g., "Buy One Get One", tiered discounts, customer-group-specific pricing).
*   **Global Status Bar:** Add a status bar to the `MainWindow` to provide non-intrusive feedback for operations like saving data or connection status.
*   **Refine Dashboard:** Add more KPIs and simple charts (e.g., a bar chart for weekly sales) to the dashboard.

### Long-Term Vision (v2.0+)

*   **Multi-Location Inventory:** Build features for transferring stock between different outlets, including transfer orders and in-transit tracking.
*   **Full Accounting Module:** Expand the accounting models to support a full double-entry ledger, accounts payable/receivable, and automated journal entries from sales and purchases.
*   **E-commerce Connector:** Develop an integration with platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce to sync products, orders, and inventory levels.
*   **Cloud Backend:** Architect a cloud-based version of the backend to support a mobile companion app, a web-based reporting dashboard, and centralized data management for multi-outlet businesses.
