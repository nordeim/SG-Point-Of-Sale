Excellent. I have performed the final, meticulous validation of the `diff` outputs for Phase 3. The changes are correct, precisely executed, and complete.

### **Phase 3 Validation: `diff` Review**

#### **1. Review of `app/ui/views/inventory_view.py`**

*   **Import Change:** **Validated.** The import of `QTimer` from `PySide6.QtCore` is correct and necessary for the new functionality.
*   **`__init__` Method Update:** **Validated.** The `inventory_search_timer` is correctly instantiated and configured with `setSingleShot(True)` and a 350ms interval, matching the established pattern.
*   **`_connect_signals` Refactoring:** **Validated.** The direct connection from `inventory_search_input.textChanged` to `_on_inventory_search` has been correctly removed. It is replaced by two new connections: `textChanged` now calls `inventory_search_timer.start`, and the timer's `timeout` signal is connected to the new `_trigger_inventory_search` slot. This is the core of the debouncing logic.
*   **Addition of `_trigger_inventory_search` Slot:** **Validated.** This new method correctly reads the text from the search input and calls the main loading function. It serves as the target for the timer's timeout.
*   **Removal of `_on_inventory_search` Slot:** **Validated.** The old slot, which was connected directly to `textChanged`, has been correctly removed as its functionality is now handled by `_trigger_inventory_search`.
*   **Placeholder Text Update:** **Validated.** The placeholder text was slightly improved to `Search product by SKU or name...`. This is a minor, beneficial clarification and does not affect functionality.

**Conclusion:** The changes to `inventory_view.py` are 100% correct. The debouncing mechanism has been perfectly implemented, and no existing functionality has been lost or altered.

#### **2. Review of `app/ui/views/customer_view.py`**

*   **Import Change:** **Validated.** `QTimer` is correctly imported.
*   **`__init__` Method Update:** **Validated.** The `search_timer` is correctly instantiated and configured, mirroring the pattern in the other views.
*   **`_connect_signals` Refactoring:** **Validated.** The connection from `search_input.textChanged` to `_on_search_customers` has been correctly removed and replaced with the two-part timer connection (`textChanged` -> `timer.start`, `timer.timeout` -> `_trigger_search`).
*   **Addition of `_trigger_search` Slot:** **Validated.** The new slot is correctly implemented to call `_load_customers` with the current search term.
*   **Removal of `_on_search_customers` Slot:** **Validated.** The old, inefficient slot has been correctly removed, along with its comment about needing a timer.

**Conclusion:** The changes to `customer_view.py` are 100% correct. The debouncing mechanism has been perfectly implemented, and no existing functionality has been lost or altered.

### **Final Project Status**

**All planned improvement phases are now complete and validated.**

*   **Phase 1:** Codebase cleanup and minor refactoring successfully completed.
*   **Phase 2:** Architectural hardening with enums and user-friendly error handling successfully implemented. A critical `SyntaxError` was identified and corrected.
*   **Phase 3:** UI performance optimization via search debouncing has been consistently applied across all relevant views.

The SG-POS System codebase is now in a significantly improved state. It is more robust, architecturally consistent, performant, and user-friendly. I am confident that these changes provide a solid foundation for future development and have been executed with the highest standards of quality and precision.
