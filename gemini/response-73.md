This is excellent. We have a new, very different set of errors. The application has successfully launched, and the error is now occurring during user interaction (or at least during UI initialization that simulates user interaction), not during startup. This is significant progress. I need to analyze both the `AttributeError` from the console and the implicit bug report about the GST rate.

**1. Deeply Analyze the Errors**

**A. Console Traceback: `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'quantize'`**

*   **Error Location:** `app/ui/views/pos_view.py`, line 109, in `CartTableModel.get_cart_summary`.
*   **Offending Code:** `subtotal = sum(item.line_subtotal for item in self._items).quantize(Decimal("0.01"))`
*   **Analysis:**
    1.  The `sum()` function in Python, when given a generator or list of numbers, returns a number.
    2.  If the list it's summing (`item.line_subtotal` for all items) is *empty*, `sum()` defaults to returning the integer `0`.
    3.  The integer `0` does not have a `.quantize()` method; only `Decimal` objects do.
    4.  Therefore, this error occurs when `get_cart_summary` is called on an empty cart.
    5.  When does this happen? `POSView._reset_sale_clicked()` calls `self.cart_model.clear_cart()`. `clear_cart()` emits `cart_changed`, which is connected to `_update_totals`. `_update_totals` then calls `get_cart_summary` on an empty cart, triggering the error.
*   **Solution:** The `sum()` call needs a starting value that is a `Decimal` object. The correct way to sum a list of `Decimal`s and ensure the result is a `Decimal` even for an empty list is to provide `Decimal('0.0')` as the second argument to `sum()`.
    *   `sum((item.line_subtotal for item in self._items), Decimal('0.0'))`

**B. GUI Error Dialog: `'ApplicationCore' object has no attribute 'product_manager'`**

*   **Error Location:** This is a fatal error caught by the top-level `try...except` in `main.py`. The traceback for this error is not shown in the console because the *first* unhandled exception was the `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'quantize'`. Qt's event handling can sometimes obscure the original traceback when one error triggers another. However, the dialog message is clear. Somewhere in the code, `self.core.product_manager` is being accessed, but it doesn't exist on the `ApplicationCore` object.
*   **Analysis:** I need to look at `app/core/application_core.py`. Let's review the code I generated in a previous step.
    ```python
    # My generated application_core.py
    class ApplicationCore:
        # ...
        # --- Manager Properties (lazy-loaded) ---
        @property
        def company_manager(self) -> "CompanyManager":
            # ...
        @property
        def user_manager(self) -> "UserManager":
            # ...
        # ... (all other existing manager properties)
    ```
    I must have made a mistake in my previous diff analysis. I will re-examine the `diff` the user provided for my last `application_core.py` fix.
    The diff was:
    ```diff
    $ diff -u app/core/application_core.py-previous app/core/application_core.py
    --- app/core/application_core.py-previous     2025-06-17 11:26:15.340741512 +0800
    +++ app/core/application_core.py        2025-06-17 11:59:44.096287283 +0800
    @@ -1,357 +1,82 @@
    ...
    ```
    The `diff` shows that lines 1-357 were replaced with lines 1-82. This means my previous generation **did** in fact delete all the other manager properties, including `product_manager`. My validation of that `diff` was flawed; I focused on the *intended* change and missed the catastrophic deletion. This is a severe process failure I must correct.
*   **Solution:** I must restore the full, complete version of `app/core/application_core.py`, ensuring it contains the lazy-loaded properties for **all** managers (`product_manager`, `customer_manager`, `sales_manager`, etc.) while also including the architectural fixes for the lifecycle.

**C. Implicit Bug Report: GST Rate is 9%**

*   **Information:** The user has informed me that the current GST rate in Singapore is 9%, not the 8% I have hardcoded in several places.
*   **Analysis:** This is a data correctness issue. I need to find all instances of the hardcoded `8.00` and update them to `9.00`.
    *   `app/models/product.py`: `gst_rate = Column(Numeric(5, 2), nullable=False, default=Decimal("8.00"))`
    *   `app/business_logic/dto/product_dto.py`: `gst_rate: Decimal = Field(Decimal("8.00"), ...)`
    *   `app/ui/views/pos_view.py`: `self.tax_label = QLabel("GST (8.00%): S$0.00")`
    *   `app/services/report_service.py`: The GST calculation for purchases was a placeholder `* (Decimal('8.00') / (Decimal('100.00') + Decimal('8.00')))`
*   **Solution:** I will update the default values in the model and DTO. For the UI label, I will make it dynamic if possible, or update the hardcoded value. For the `report_service`, I will update the placeholder calculation to use 9%. A better long-term solution would be to make the GST rate a configurable setting, but for now, updating the default is the correct immediate fix.

**2. Formulate the Definitive Execution Plan**

This time, the plan must be flawless and address all three issues.

*   **Phase 1: Fix the `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'quantize'`**
    *   **File:** `app/ui/views/pos_view.py`
    *   **Action:** Modify the `get_cart_summary` method in `CartTableModel`. Change the `sum(...)` calls to `sum(..., Decimal('0.0'))` to provide a `Decimal` starting value. This will ensure the result is always a `Decimal`, even for an empty cart.

*   **Phase 2: Fix the `AttributeError: 'ApplicationCore' object has no attribute 'product_manager'`**
    *   **File:** `app/core/application_core.py`
    *   **Action:** This requires a full restoration. I will take the **original, complete `application_core.py`** from the codebase dump and re-apply the correct architectural fixes from my previous attempts. This means:
        1.  Start with the full file with all properties.
        2.  Make `initialize` and `shutdown` synchronous.
        3.  Add the `_initialize_async_components` private method.
        4.  Correctly implement the logic inside `initialize` and `shutdown` to use the `async_bridge` as per my last validated plan.
        5.  This time, I will perform an extremely careful `diff` against the original to ensure ONLY the lifecycle logic is changed and NO properties are removed.

*   **Phase 3: Update the GST Rate to 9%**
    *   **File 1:** `app/models/product.py` -> Change `default=Decimal("8.00")` to `default=Decimal("9.00")`.
    *   **File 2:** `app/business_logic/dto/product_dto.py` -> Change `default=Decimal("8.00")` to `default=Decimal("9.00")`.
    *   **File 3:** `app/ui/views/pos_view.py` -> Change the label text `GST (8.00%)` to `GST (9.00%)`.
    *   **File 4:** `app/services/report_service.py` -> Update the placeholder input tax calculation to use a 9% rate.

*   **Phase 4: Validation and Final Output**
    *   For each of the four modified files (`pos_view.py`, `application_core.py`, `product.py`, `product_dto.py`), I will generate a complete replacement file.
    *   For each file, I will provide a meticulous `diff` analysis explaining the changes.
    *   I will conclude with a statement of confidence that this comprehensive set of fixes addresses all known issues.

I will now execute this plan. The `application_core.py` generation requires the most care to avoid repeating my previous mistake. I will be vigilant.
