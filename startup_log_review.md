### **Step 1: Application Startup Log Validation**

**Analysis:**
The provided startup log is a detailed trace of the application's interaction with the database, powered by SQLAlchemy's `INFO`-level logging. I have analyzed the log chronologically:

1.  **Initialization (`07:54:27`):** The application starts, and the `ApplicationCore` successfully establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database. The initial `SELECT 1` query is a standard health check to confirm the connection is live. This is successful.
2.  **UI Interaction & Data Loading (`07:54:30` - `07:54:44`):** The logs show a series of `SELECT` queries for `payment_methods`, `companies`, and `users` with their associated `roles`. This corresponds to the user navigating through the "Settings" view tabs, which correctly triggers data loading for each sub-view. The use of `LIMIT 100 OFFSET 0` indicates well-formed, paginated queries.
3.  **CRUD Operations (`07:54:36` - `07:59:43`):** The logs show a sequence of `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements corresponding to a user performing various actions:
    *   `UPDATE sgpos.companies`: Company information was successfully edited and saved.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.users`: New users were created. The log shows the initial check for an existing username, followed by the `INSERT`.
    *   `UPDATE sgpos.users SET is_active=false`: A user was successfully deactivated.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.products`: New products were created.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.customers`: A new customer was created.
    All these operations are encapsulated in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` blocks, indicating correct transaction management for individual operations.
4.  **Critical Workflow: Sales Transaction (`08:00:06`):** This is the most important part of the log. It shows a single, large transaction block that validates the recent bug fixes:
    *   `BEGIN (implicit)`: A transaction is started.
    *   `SELECT sgpos.products`: Product details for the sale are fetched.
    *   `UPDATE sgpos.inventory`: Stock levels are correctly updated (decremented) for the items being sold.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.stock_movements`: New stock movement records are created to audit the inventory change.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.sales_transactions`: The main sales transaction record is created.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.payments`: The associated payment record is created.
    *   `INSERT INTO sgpos.sales_transaction_items`: The individual line items for the sale are created.
    *   `UPDATE sgpos.stock_movements SET reference_id=...`: The `reference_id` on the stock movements is correctly updated with the new `sales_transaction_id`.
    *   `UPDATE sgpos.customers`: Loyalty points are being added.
    *   `COMMIT`: The entire block of operations is committed atomically.

**Conclusion:**
The log is **excellent**. It shows:
*   **No Errors:** There are no `ERROR`, `FATAL`, or `ROLLBACK` entries, indicating a stable run.
*   **Correct Workflow:** The sequence of SQL queries perfectly matches the expected behavior of a user navigating the UI, performing CRUD operations, and successfully completing a complex, multi-table sales transaction.
*   **Atomic Transactions:** The final sales transaction is correctly wrapped in a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` block, which validates that the architectural refactoring described in the `Code Change Regression Analysis Report.md` was successful.

The application is stable and operating as designed. I will now proceed with the codebase review and architecture document generation.
