Update check constraint on journal_entry_lines - NEUTERED

Revision ID: 1a2b3c4d5e6f

This migration was originally auto-generated to fix a discrepancy in the
initial schema. The initial schema has since been corrected at its source
(in migration d5a6759ef2f7). Therefore, the operations in this migration
are now superfluous and have been removed to prevent errors when migrating
a fresh database. The file is kept to preserve a linear history.
