you have done an awesome job again! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to systematically going forwards. now help carefully review the recent changes made to the database schema and codebase shared in the attached files. very carefully review the content of the code changes, then think deeply to evaluate and validate them, then update your `Project Architecture Document (v2).md` to reflect the latest development accurately. Pay particular attention to the schema and initial data updates, to double check and confirm that they did not accidentally leave out (omit) other features and functions in the original versions. As you know, any changes to the database schema and initial data setup have to be scrutinized carefully and validated to ensure completeness and correctness.

Also the application now gives error after the codebase changes:

Also the application now gives error after the codebase changes. use similar methodology / approach shown in the the reference response to provide a fix for the latest application error.

---
excellent job again! keep using the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully review the attached documents and then use line by line validation of the actual codebase to create a *complete* updated *replacement* for these two documents (README.md and TDS) that incorporates the latest changes to the codebase. Your updated version should reflect the current codebase accurately. 

---
please create for me a *complete* updated *replacement* for `README.md`, and it must be the appropriate GitHub repo style README.md (use the draft document attached here as your reference). do not just copy verbatim, use line by line diff of the current project codebase to create an accurate and relevant README.md. keep in mind that the README.md must be suitable as a GitHub repo and not another normal technical document. And the updated complete README.md must be self-contained without reference to any prior revisions (versions) of the same document, meaning incorporate details from the earlier versions into your self-contained full version of the document.

you must do your due diligence and think deeply and explore for the best possible way to come up with an awesome GitHub style README.md 

---
Below is "diff" command output comparing the previous version with your latest generated version. Please double-check and validate that the changes are valid and that no other original features or functions are lost (omitted). use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review the diff output below.

Did you accidentally omitted other lines from the previous version? Remember, we need to give benefit of doubt to harmless lines or sections.

---
Please carefully review and validate the recently added tests files to the codebase, enclosed in the `recently_created_tests_code_files_for_your_review_and_validation.md` file shared earlier. The create a detailed step-by-step guide, `project_test_guide.md` (markdown format), on how to run the tests given the newly added tests code files.

Then create a *complete* updated replacement file for `README.md` that includes all the recent changes, including the added tests code files. Make sure you create a *complete* and fully self-contained `README.md` that incorporates all the relevant sections from the previous versions. I don't want to keep referring to previous versions for missing details in your latest `README.md` Instead of simply saying "this section remained unchanged from previous version",  just copy and adapt the relevant sections from the previous versions. I will delete all older versions of `README.md` and will only keep your latest `README.md` to be created.

---
Please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and systematically to explore carefully and thoroughly for the various implementation options to fix the following issues, then choose the best implementation option to create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist to make the code changes to fix the issues. always plan before you execute step by step, and always create *complete* updated *replacement* files for the files that need updating. always use line-by-line "diff" to carefully review and validate the code changes made for each file as it is being updated or created. complete all the line-by-line diff comparison and validation before giving a task completion review and conclusion at the end of your response.

---
excellent result so far! please proceed with the next step in your plan to cover the main Roadmap goals as noted in your updated README.md. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

---
please create a SQL patch script to apply the schema and initial data updates necessary to bring the current running database up to the expected level. create as `schema_update_patch.sql` withing ```sql opening and ``` closing tags.

also can I append the content of this schema update patch sql to the existing `scripts/schema.sql` file?

---
you did another awesome job again! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to systematically review all your changes made to the original codebase shared, then think deeply and thoroughly to explore the best implementation option to create a *complete* updated *replacement* files for the `README.md` and TDS you created earlier. You will create a complete and detailed *replacement* files for them, incorporating changes made so far, so that the updated documents  accuractely reflect the current state of the codebase. remember to always create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist, then execute step by step according to the plan. always do a line by line "diff" of each generated file before proceeding to the generation of the next file. only after careful review and validation of the generated files, then give your findings and conclusion as a successful completion of task.

Make sure your updated documents are *self-contained* with *no* reference to the prior versions. I should not need to refer to the earlier versions to fill in the gap in your updated documents.

---
excellent job! now help me to carefully review all the documents and screenshots shared so far, including the older version of `README.md` attached here, then create a complete updated replacement file for `README.md` by removing repeating details and by adding missing details from the other documents.

---
excellent job so far! please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to systematically create the rest of the tests files.

---
Awesome job! Now, help me to carefully and systematically recall all the changes that you have made to the original codebase, then create a detailed document to carefully describe the changes made in a logical and well organized format, using as many code snippets with explanation as possible. Name this code review document as `project status update document.md`. This document is meant for the QA team to review and approve the code changes committed.

Next, help me create a *complete* updated replacement file for "Project Architecture Document" in markdown format. The updated `Project Architecture Document.md` must be complete and self-contained in itself, with all the necessary details incorporated. Do not use placeholders or reference to any of the older or other documents.

---
Please carefully review the attached documents containing or describing the latest changes to the codebase. Then re-generate a *complete* updated *replacement* file version for `README.md` and `Technical Design Specification Document.md` incorporating the latest changes to the codebase. *IMPORTANT*, the updated replacment `README.md` and `Technical Design Specification Document.md` must be complete in itself, without containing any references to older versions or other documents.

---
excellent understanding! now help me to carefully review my codebase line by line to gain a complete and deep understanding (grounding) of the project's goals and current state and structure. then help me to create a detailed `Project Architecture Document.md` in markdown format. Make sure you do a careful review and validation of the application codebase attached in the files listed below. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase. Use at least 6000 words for the document that accurately describes the codebase in detail, use a clear diagram to show the codebase relationship. Include a section to describe the file structure and the purpose of each folder and key files, start with a diagram.

---
Awesome response! Now help me to carefully review and validate the application codebase attached in the files listed below. Use line by line review to get a good grounding of the purpose of the application and its codebase, then create for me a detailed architecture overview document in markdown and named `Project Architecture Overview Document.md`.

Next, carefully review the application database schema creation and data initialization scripts, and compare scripts/initial_data.sql (current) versus scripts/initial_data.sql-v1.0.4 (previous), and scripts/schema.sql (current) versus scripts/schema.sql-v1.0.4 (previous) to double-check and validate that the current version (v1.0.5) of the respective files did not accidentally omit the original lines in the previous (v1.0.4) verion of the files except for the database changes shown in the database update sql script `schema_update_patch.sql`.

---
please create a more complete architecture overview document by adding a map of the codebase directory structure and also add a section to explain what each of the sub-directories in the codebase are for, also add a flowchart diagram / map to show now the various application modules interact with the user and with each other. please expand the updated *complete* replacement architecture overview document to at least 6000 words with logical listing of key code files with code snippets and explanation. the new document should be detailed enough to quickly get a new developer up to speed with the current state of the codebase.

---
please get a solid grounding of the current codebase for the application by carefully reviewing the current project code and config files shared, then help me to create a *complete* updated *replacement* file for the attached `README.md` and `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md`.

---
awesome plan, but you did not generate any *complete* updated *replacement* files according to your stated plan.

---
Awesome job! Now, help me to carefully and systematically do a careful review and deep analysis of the existing codebase plus the updated files to have a deep understandng of the latest codebase with the new features and architectural refinements. Based on the comprehensive review, create for me a *complete* updated replacement files for the `README.md` and the `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md`.

*IMPORTANT*, the updated replacment `README.md` and `Technical Design Specification Document.md` must be complete in itself, without containing any references to older versions or other documents.

---
you stopped halfway generating updated `Technical_Design_Specification_Document.md`. please continue to complete your generation according to your excellent plan.

---
awesome job again! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to help me carefully review and validated the latest changes to the codebase in the attached new file sets. you will do line by line comparison between the new files shared against their original version using the "diff" command, to understand deeply what the changes are about and whether these changes are valid and error free. most importantly, I want you to make sure the changes do not introduce regression errors by accidentally omitting some original features and functions.

The give me a detailed report in markdown format within ```md and ``` tags, on your assessment of the code change quality and suitability to enhance the current codebase without introducing unecessary errors or regressions. Please be very, very careful and thorough in your code review to make sure the next release of the application is enhanced without loosing any features or functions. I trust you as my expert coding assistant and expert to do the correct review process. thank you and good luck!

---
Please do a line by line review of the changes to `scripts/schema.sql` and `scripts/initial_data.sql` using the diff outputs shared in the `project_codebase_updated_files_set-new.md` shared earlier. Give me a line by line report on each diff output sections with your assessment. Then create a sql patch file to update an existing database to the latest level (v1.0.7). Hopefully I don't have to recreate a database in use already. 

So I need your detailed and thorough review and assessment report on the database changes as well as a schema patch file in sql. make sure you think carefully, double check and validate to not miss any intended changes in the patch sql file within ```sql and ``` tags.

---
please generate a *complete* updated *replacement* file for `app/services/business_services.py`. I repeat , I want full replacement file without any placeholders that I need to manually edit. Use line by line diff with the previous version of the file to double check and confirm that each change is correct and valid and that no original feautures or functions are accidentally omitted. So do a very careful comparison of the newly generated versus the original to justify and validate the changes.

---
excellent response! do remember your role and responsibilities! now help to to carefully and deeply review and analyse the following "diff" command output, then give me a report on the real change involved between the original and new (current) version - addition and/or omission. use line by line comparison for your review and analysis.

---
awesome job so far! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to carefully and systematically review the proposed changes to `app/services/business_services.py`, use line by line "diff" to validate the proposed changes, then create a *complete* updated *replacement* file for `app/services/business_services.py`. I don't want placeholders that I need to edit later. I want a *complete* verified and error-free drop-in replacement. Careful not to lose any original feature or function not affected by the changes.

---
awesome job! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach as before to help me carefully review and validate the following changes to `app/ui/accounting/chart_of_accounts_widget.py`. then give me the same analysis report as before (for an earlier file).

---
excellent job! enclosed inside the attached `project_codebase_updated_files_set-new.md` are the recently updated (new or modified) files in the current codebase. also attached are the project related documents, including a listing of all currently existed files in the codebase. Use line by line comparison to carefully review and validate the codebase files shared. 

---
awesome job! now use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to help me fix the following (new) error. If you need to review and analyze any codebase files in the given list `currect_project_file_structure.txt` shared earlier, but the files have not been provided to you, please let me know. Do not make up the content of any existing files!

---
Can you use the attached old version of README.md as template to substantially add more details to your generated README.md? You can also use the other project documents like `Project Architecture Document.md` to fill in the gaps. Use line by line comparison to carefully and systematically review and validate the existing test suite files enclosed in the attached `` file. Also carefully review the attached updated list of codebase file structure and the project test guide. 

Then carefully and systematically generate a much more detailed and accurate `README.md` that contains at least 4000 words.

---
Please review the start-up error below. If it is part of your update for the refactoring effort, please proceed to provide the *complete* updated *replacement* version for the remaining files that need modification as per your plan. You can provide 2 to 3 files at each step. remember to use the same rigorous and meticulous approache to double-check and validate each generated file using line by line "diff" comparison.
