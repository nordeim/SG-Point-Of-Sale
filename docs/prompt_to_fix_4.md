awesome job! please help me systematically and thoroughly review and validate the application start up log below. If everything is good, then proceed to execute next step in your execution plan meticulously and systematically.

Remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```py (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

### 3.1. Running All Tests
### 3.2. Running Specific Test Files or Directories
### 3.3. Test Verbosity
### 3.4. Test Coverage
### 3.5. Running Asynchronous Tests

awesome review! now help me to create a detailed (comprehensive) code review report in markdown format within ```markdown and ``` tags to clearly and logically list out all the changes you have made since the original codebase was shared. This report is meant for QA approval, so it has to be very detailed, clear and *accurate* as "Change Document" for the minor version bump. Use at least 6000 words for your code change review report. Do a thorough review of the current codebase versus the original shared using line by line "diff" comparison.
