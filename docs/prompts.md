that is an awesome design! but I think you can create an even better design than this, right? please think more deeply and explore more thoroughly on the various implementation options, but choosing the most impressive and absolute best, beating all existing POS system design out there. Please try again with your absolute very best effort! thank you and good luck!

---
that is really awesome! I like it. Can you create an equally awesome GitHub repository `README.md` for this project with at least 4000 words. Hopefully, your awesome README.md will attract widespread developer interests to this project!

---
That is an awesome design! Please help me create an equally awesome `README.md` for the GitHub repository for this project. Use at least 4000 words to be as detailed as possible. Hopefully it will be able to attract as many developers to this project as possible.

---
really awesome README.md! Please help me create the complete database schema for your design. Thank you!

---
please confirm that you have provided the *complete* tested sql script to create the correct and working database schema based on your "super-set" design. If yes, please also create a step by step guide to deploy the postgresql database with the given schema. create a detailed `deployment_guide for_postgresql_database.md`. 

---
awesome job! Please help me create a complete / generate `docker-compose.dev.yml` based on your design. Thank you for your excellent help!

---
awesome job! Please help me create a complete / generate `docker-compose.dev.yml` based on your design. also provide a detailed step-by-step guide to deploy a docker container using the compose YML file. please enclose the YML within ```yml and ``` tags, the docker deployment guide within ```md and ``` tags. Thank you for your excellent help!

---
wow, that is an awesome docker compose YML! You are the best absolute best designer and coder! Please also help me to create a complete `pyproject.toml`.

---
wow, you have dome a fantastic job with the database schema creation script and guide. Now, please create  a detailed `Project Architecture Document.md` that includes a complete codebase file hierarchy structure and a list of code files with their description, goals and purpose and a definition of their interfaces for interacting with other modules or functions. Use at least 6000 words for the PAD to make it as clear, logical and a useful and helpful handbook for developers to work collaboratively to work independently on different parts of the codebase. Include a bash script to create the actual codebase file directory structure with respect to the project root folder. Use "mkdir -p " to reduce the number of "mkdir" commands to the minimum.

---
wow, you have done yet another awesome job! please help me create a complete `app/core.py` within ```python and ``` tags so that I can use it to jump start the whole application development!

---
I have received many design proposals for my project. Since I am not a design or coding expert like you, please help me to carefully evaluate and validate them (attached) one by one, then create a 6000 words research report on your assessment of the submitted designs. Compare and rank each of the designs in your report, rank them in a list starting with the "best" design (please help me to establish a ranking criteria) at the top of the list.

---
That is an awesome report, clear and very helpful. Though I am not technical, I feel it would be a waste to just choose design #18 and discard other designs. How about this - as the absolute expert in both design and coding, help me create a super-set PRD can combines the best of the top design submissions and then generate a detailed, logical, and absolutely help PRD that will make it total no-brainer for a fresh development to complete the software development for the project. Please use at least 6000 words to make your "super-set" PRD very detailed, fool-proof, and easy to follow. Thank you very much!

---
You are really the absolute star of software engineering! Now help me to create a "Project Management Document.md` to help me manage a team of fresh developers. Specify the codebase development into 5 stages or segments that can be worked on independently. For each development stage and segment, specify the files and modules to build as the goals and objectives for that stage or segment, with a description and a checklist for acceptance of each file needed for that stage. Basically, the document is to help the project manager manage different teams to work collaboratively to complete the development of the entire codebase efficiently. Please provide as detailed and clear as possible to help me manage the development successfully. Please use at least 6000 words so that the document is as detailed as possible to help a non-technical and non-expert Project Manager like me. Thank you for your very best effort and help!  

---
Wow, you are indeed the absolute king of software design and engineering! While I recruit members for my development team. Please help me complete stage 1 in your PMD. It will really help me to establish an absolutely solid foundation for the project, as well as a perfect model for the project members to emulate and follow to achieve the best coding design and quality. A POS system is the foundation tool of any retailer, so it must absolutely be stable, error-free, reliable, and secure. It is the essential tool for any retail business owner, so I want you to establish the kind of code quality that the project will be proud of to associate with and emulate. Thank you and good luck!

---
You have proven yourself yet again to be the absolute best software architect, designer, and engineer in the universe! Now I have a challenge: finding an experienced software developer who can match our quality expectations has proved to be tougher than I expected. I am still searching for such a team member. In the meantime, I still have to rely and depend on you to help me complete stage #2 of the project as spelled out in your superlative PMD. Please kindly help me create all the code and config files expected for stage #2 of your PMD.

---
Wow, wow, you are absolutely unbelievable! Now I am in even greater pressure to find human developers who are even close to your standard and quality. I am still having great challenge. How about you help me complete stage #3 in your PMD as well? Please help to create all the necessary files in stage #3. I will your code files for stage #2 and #3 to train my human developers. Thank you and appreciate it very much!

---
you stopped midway. please continue to complete your database schema generation as planned.
