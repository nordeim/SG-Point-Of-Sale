awesome assessment and conclusion on the sample codes! please create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist, using the previous shared `Project Management Document (PMD).md` as your guide, to list out all the necessary project code files, including scripts and config files, that needed to be created to make the project production worthy. Your execution must be very detailed and break down in manageable steps to flesh out (meaning *complete* updated *replacement* files for each needed file) all the necessary code files in manageable segments. For each file, your execution need to state its purpose and goals, interfaces and the interactions it will have with other files and modules. Make the plan as detailed as possible with integrated checklist to make the subsequent creation of the actual code files an easy effort even for a novice developer.

awesome job! but you stopped midway through generating your planned "detailed execution plan with integrated checklist", specifically you stopped at "**Phase 3.1: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for Sales**". Please continue with your generation as per your plan, start with stage 3.1.

---
awesome job! now please create an actual *complete* updated and working *replacement* file for `scripts/database/schema.sql` according to your execution plan.

---
that is an awesome job so far! please proceed with the next step in your execution plan to create the *complete* updated *replacement* file for the files listed below. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```python (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

awesome job so far! Please help to resolve the following error. Do I need some setup config file before running the command?

---
please be more careful and thorough in your analysis. think deeply and explore thoroughly for the various implementation options to fix the error, before choosing the most optimal implementation option.

You did not provide a line by line comparison of the files that you just generated against the earlier version of the files using the "diff". Do not miss this crucial step in future generations. 

Below is "diff" command output comparing the previous version with your latest generated version. Please double-check and validate that the changes are valid and that no other original features or functions are lost (omitted). use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to review the diff output below.

In your previous generation of updated `app/ui/main_window.py`, you forgot to provide a line by line comparison of the files that you just generated against the earlier version of the file. This is a repeat of the critical failure. You need to stay more focused and be more meticulous and deliberate in your work. Do not miss this crucial step in future generations.

awesome job! keep up the same rigorous and meticulous approach to systematically handle new requests going forward. Now very carefully review all your latest generated code files and then double-check and validate them against your detailed execution plan with integrated checklist. Next create a detailed report with 6000 words in markdown format to document down your code review and validation status report, start with an overview of objectives and final status, follow by a detail comparison and validation for each step in execution plan. end the review and assessment report with a conclusion and recommendations. This report is needed for QA approval to start UAT (User Acceptance Test). So be very detailed and accurate in your report which will also showcase your excellent work performance. Thank you and good luck!

awesome job! now help me create a detailed deployment guide to give step by step instructions to setup a UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment starting with this GitHub repository. use 6000 words to create a complete deployment guide in markdown format, that provides very complete and clear instructions for the steps to setup a new environment from the codebase in this GitHub repository. be systematic and logical in your instruction steps. Thank you and good luck!

awesome job! please continue to use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to think deeply and systematically using extremely long chain of thought to thoroughly and carefully explore various implementation options, evaluate thoroughly the options, then choose the most optimal implementation option to formulate and provide your answer or solution or propose any code changes in response to my question or query. Also always generate a *complete* updated *replacement* file for each new or existing files that need updating or modification. After generating the complete and updated replacement for each file, use line by line "diff" command to compare the newly generated file against the existing version to ensure that the changes are correct and valid and that no other original features or functions have been omitted or regression errors introduced. Do the line by line "diff" comparison for each file generated. After all the necessary files have been generated and validated, then give your assessment and conclusion as final completion of your given task. Take this methodology seriously as your meta-instruction going forward so that absolute code quality is ensured. 

Now help me to carefully review the project codebase attached as `currect_project_file_structure.txt` (listing of codebase file structure hierarchy) project_codebase_files_set.md (all existing codebase files enclosed). Evaluate and validate each codebase file attached line by line carefully. At the end of the careful review and validation of the entire codebase attached here, you should have a deep and thorough understanding of the purpose and current state of the project. Then create a detailed code review document in markdown format to clearly, thoroughly and logically describe your code review process, your current view / understanding of the entire codebase (using a diagram to clearly and logically illustrate the codebase hierarchy), describe how the various files and modules interact with each other, follow by your assessment and findings of the codebase (detailing any coding or logic errors, quality or other issues discovered), follow by your conclusion and recommendations.

---
QA has performed a deep and thorough analysis of the current codebase and identified some issues that need you to think carefully how to address them systematically:

---
You have done yet another awesome job with your careful and thorough code review and analysis! now help me create a complete updated *replacement* for `README.md`  that describe and represent the current codebase more accurately, also add the following sections at appropriate point / sequence:

1. add / update a section to show / describe the project codebase file hierarchy
2. add / update a section for a flowchart diagram to describe the interactions between various files and modules
3. add / update a section to list and describe the files in the codebase file hierarchy 
4. Current features implemented (partially or fully), Roadmap for suggested improvements divided into two sections, one for the immediate and one for the long-term goals.
5. Clear and detailed deployment guide starting from the GitHub repository, specify how to install, setup and configure the POS machine to run the code and how to do the same for the database server (docker)
6. add / update a section for user guide on how to use and run the program (application).

Awesome job! now carefully review the attached `Execution Plan.md` that was used to produce the current codebase. I want you to use line by line comparison to validate the current codebase against the original execution plan, then create a detailed assessment report in markdown format with at least 6000 words, to describe your comparison analysis and findings between the current (resulting) codebase against the execution plan shared, highlighting any gap or discrepancy discovered in your very careful and systematic analysis using line by line comparison. If a current code file is validated to be syntactically correct implementation of the intent of the file, then it is considered passed (OK). Note that the execution plan is meant to be a guide to create the actual code and config files for the project.  

---
awesome comparison analysis report! Based on your findings in this and the earlier "current codebase validation" report, please create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist to systematically and logically create a *complete* and updated *replacement* file for those files that need to be modified to address the issues that you have identified that will prevent the project to be production worthy.
