awesome assessment and conclusion on the sample codes! please create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist, using the previous shared `Project Management Document (PMD).md` as your guide, to list out all the necessary project code files, including scripts and config files, that needed to be created to make the project production worthy. Your execution must be very detailed and break down in manageable steps to flesh out (meaning *complete* updated *replacement* files for each needed file) all the necessary code files in manageable segments. For each file, your execution need to state its purpose and goals, interfaces and the interactions it will have with other files and modules. Make the plan as detailed as possible with integrated checklist to make the subsequent creation of the actual code files an easy effort even for a novice developer.

awesome job! but you stopped midway through generating your planned "detailed execution plan with integrated checklist", specifically you stopped at "**Phase 3.1: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for Sales**". Please continue with your generation as per your plan, start with stage 3.1.

---
awesome job! now please create an actual *complete* updated and working *replacement* file for `scripts/database/schema.sql` according to your execution plan.

that is an awesome job so far! please proceed with the next step in your execution plan to create the *complete* updated *replacement* file for the files listed below. remember to explore carefully for multiple implementation options before choosing the most optimal and elegant solution to implement the changes. so you have to think deeply and systematically to explore all options and not just choose any option you may think of. also make sure you make a detailed execution plan with an integrated checklist for each step, before proceeding cautiously step by step. after completing each step, always double-check and validate your changes for that step against its checklist before proceeding to the next step. remember to always create a *complete* and updated replacement or new file for the affected files, enclose each complete and updated replacement file within ```python (or ```sql or ```js or or ```ts or ```tsx ```php extension) opening and ``` closing tags. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. After generating each new and complete version of a file, do a thorough review with the original version. after creating each file, use line by line "diff" command to double-check and validate the created file. Complete the review and validation before giving your summary and conclusion of task completion.

The important point is to proceed very carefully so as not to introduce any regression error or accidentally omit the original features or functions. use the same tested rigorous and meticulous approach. thank you and good luck!

awesome job so far! Please help to resolve the following error. Do I need some setup config file before running the command?

---
please be more careful and thorough in your analysis. think deeply and explore thoroughly for the various implementation options to fix the error, before choosing the most optimal implementation option.
