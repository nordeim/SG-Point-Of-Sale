awesome assessment and conclusion on the sample codes! please create a detailed execution plan with integrated checklist, using the previous shared `Project Management Document (PMD).md` as your guide, to list out all the necessary project code files, including scripts and config files, that needed to be created to make the project production worthy. Your execution must be very detailed and break down in manageable steps to flesh out (meaning *complete* updated *replacement* files for each needed file) all the necessary code files in manageable segments. For each file, your execution need to state its purpose and goals, interfaces and the interactions it will have with other files and modules. Make the plan as detailed as possible with integrated checklist to make the subsequent creation of the actual code files an easy effort even for a novice developer.

awesome job! but you stopped midway through generating your planned "detailed execution plan with integrated checklist", specifically you stopped at "**Phase 3.1: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for Sales**". Please continue with your generation as per your plan, start with stage 3.1.

awesome job! now please create an actual *complete* updated and working *replacement* file for `scripts/database/schema.sql` according to your execution plan.
