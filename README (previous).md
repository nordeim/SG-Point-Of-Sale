## **1. Introduction: What is SG-POS?**

**SG-POS** is a free and open-source Point-of-Sale system, engineered from the ground up to address the specific operational and regulatory challenges faced by Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) in Singapore. It aims to provide the power and polish of expensive enterprise systems in an accessible, modern, and maintainable package.

### The Problem We're Solving

Retail in Singapore is a dynamic and demanding environment. Business owners often find themselves caught between several undesirable options:
1.  **Generic International POS Systems:** These are often powerful but expensive, and their features are not tailored to Singapore's unique market. GST compliance can be a clumsy add-on, and support for local payment methods like NETS and PayNow is often lacking.
2.  **Legacy Local POS Systems:** While they may handle local regulations, these systems are often built on dated technology, leading to slow performance, clunky user interfaces, poor security, and a lack of modern integration capabilities.
3.  **Basic Tablet-Based Apps:** These are user-friendly but frequently lack the depth required for serious inventory management, multi-outlet operations, and comprehensive financial reporting.

SG-POS bridges this gap. It is a "pro-tool" for the serious SMB, combining a deep understanding of the local context with world-class software architecture.

### Our Vision

Our vision is to empower every Singaporean SMB retailer with a digital tool that is a genuine asset to their business‚Äînot a necessary evil. We aim to create a system that is:

*   **Effortlessly Compliant:** Takes the headache out of GST filing and financial auditing.
*   **Operationally Excellent:** Speeds up checkout lines, automates inventory management, and provides clarity.
*   **A Source of Insight:** Transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence.
*   **A Joy to Use:** An intuitive, responsive, and reliable tool that staff genuinely appreciate.

## **5. Architectural Deep Dive**

SG-POS is built on a set of robust architectural principles designed for maintainability and scalability.

### The Layered Architecture

Our architecture strictly separates the application into four logical layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Presentation Layer (UI)] --> B[Business Logic Layer];
    B --> C[Data Access Layer];
    C --> D[Persistence Layer (Database)];
```

1.  **Presentation Layer (`app/ui`):** This layer is responsible *only* for what the user sees and how they interact with it. It's built with PySide6 and contains no business logic. It receives data and sends user actions to the layer below.
2.  **Business Logic Layer (`app/business_logic`):** This is the brain of the application. It contains the business rules, orchestrates workflows, and makes decisions. For example, the `SalesManager` decides if a discount is valid or if enough stock exists to complete a sale. It is completely independent of the UI.
3.  **Data Access Layer (`app/services`):** This layer's job is to talk to the database. It implements the **Repository Pattern**, providing a clean, abstract API (e.g., `product_service.get_by_sku()`) that the business logic can use without needing to know anything about SQL or database tables.
4.  **Persistence Layer (`app/models`):** This layer defines the shape of our data using SQLAlchemy ORM models, which map directly to our PostgreSQL database tables.

### The Asynchronous Model

To ensure the UI is always fast and responsive, we run all I/O-bound operations (like database queries and API calls) in the background.

*   The **UI runs on the main thread** in the Qt event loop.
*   All other work happens in a **separate worker thread** running an `asyncio` event loop.
*   A special **thread-safe bridge** allows the UI to safely request work from the async thread and receive results back without freezing. This is crucial for a smooth user experience.

### Core Design Patterns

*   **Dependency Injection (DI) via `ApplicationCore`:** We avoid tight coupling by using a central `ApplicationCore` object. Instead of a component creating its own dependencies (like a database connection), it asks the `ApplicationCore` for it. This makes testing incredibly easy, as we can provide "mock" dependencies during tests.

*   **Result Pattern:** For operations that can fail in predictable ways (e.g., "insufficient stock"), our functions don't raise exceptions. Instead, they return a `Result` object, which is either a `Success` containing the value, or a `Failure` containing an error object. This makes error handling explicit and robust.

*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** We use Pydantic models to define the structure of data that moves between layers. This ensures that the data is always in the expected format and provides a clear "contract" for what each layer expects to receive and send.

---

## **6. Database Design**

Our database is the bedrock of the system's data integrity.

*   **Engine:** PostgreSQL 15+ for its reliability, performance, and advanced features.
*   **Schema Principles:**
    *   **UUIDs for Primary Keys:** To support future scalability and prevent key collisions.
    *   **Strict Normalization (3NF):** To reduce data redundancy and improve consistency.
    *   **Referential Integrity:** Enforced with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
    *   **Data Types:** Correct types are used for all data (`NUMERIC` for money, `TIMESTAMPTZ` for dates/times).
    *   **Comprehensive Auditing:** A dedicated `audit_logs` table tracks all significant changes to the data, which is critical for financial compliance.

For the complete database schema, please see the `schema.sql` file in the `/scripts/database` directory.
